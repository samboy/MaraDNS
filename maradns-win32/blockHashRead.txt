=== NAME ===

blockHashRead - Read a block hash file 

=== DESCRIPTION ===

blockHashRead is a stand alone command line tool which converts a block 
hash file in to a list of hostnames. This way, a binary block hash file 
can be converted in to an ASCII list of host names, edited, and then 
converted back in to a binary block hash file with the blockHashMake 
utility. 

A block hash file uses a special binary format for storing a list of 
blocked host names. 

=== USAGE ===

blockHashRead is invoked as follows:

blockHashRead --dump bigBlock.bin

Replace "bigBlock.bin" with the filename for the block hash file. 

Doing this will output, on standard output, a list of host names in the 
block hash file. Each line will contain a single host name. When 
compiled for *NIX, the output will use *NIX line feeds; the Windows 
port of blockHashRead uses DOS line feeds. 

blockHashRead can be invoked with a single "--help" or "--version" 
command line argument (e.g. "blockHashRead --version") which will 
output the version number of blockHashRead and provide basic usage 
information. 

=== HOST LIST FORMAT ===

After being invoked, blockHashRead writes a list of host names to the 
standard output. The format is a single host name per line of input, 
such as the following:

porn.example.com 
naughty.foo 
evil.host.invalid

Each line is a host name. 

blockHashRead has no support for Punycode. Please use another program 
to convert international domain names with non-ASCII characters in to 
their non-punycode representation if seeing correct international 
domain names is desired. 

=== LIMITATIONS ===

The block hash format that blockHashRead looks at is a 32-bit format, 
and the resulting block hash file should be under 2,147,483,648 bytes 
in size. This is a limitation of around 30 million host names.
