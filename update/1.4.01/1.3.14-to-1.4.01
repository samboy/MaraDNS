# To run this script, make sure that this script is in the directory
# containing the tarball for the version of MaraDNS you wish to update, and
# all of the patches are in a directory entitled 'patches'.

# For example, to update MaraDNS 1.3.02 to 1.3.03, make sure 
# maradns-1.3.02.tar.lzma is in the same directory as this script, and
# that the directory containing this script has a directory called
# "patches/" which has all of the maradns-1.2.02*.patch files.

# You will need to have lzma 4.27 on your system to run this script
# Do not use a newer version of lzma; the flags changed
