<h1>MaraDNS troubleshooting guide</h1>

This troubleshooting guide is an example of how problems with MaraDNS
may be resolved without needing to wait for support on the MaraDNS
mailing list.  This guide is a troubleshooting example that was written using 
MaraDNS on an older CentOS 3.8 system.  Adapt this guide for the OS being
used. <p>

The problem we will troubleshoot in this example is MaraDNS not
responding to DNS queries.  As we will see in this guide, a number of
different issues can cause this problem, and resolving the problem
depends on what issue is causing the problem. <p>

As just some of the possible issues, it is possible that the MaraDNS
process is not running at all.  It's possible that MaraDNS is running,
but can't bind to the assigned IP (because of a Linux bug, MaraDNS can
not accurately report this problem when run in Linux). <p>

Here are some hints: <p>

<ul>
<li>Use the askmara client, not dig, not host, not nslookup, and not
djbdns' DNS lookup thingy to perform DNS queries.  Why?  Because this
document shows you what askmara's replies are when sending DNS queries.

<li>Keep the mararc short and simple while troubleshooting:

<pre>
ipv4_bind_addresses = "127.0.0.1"
chroot_dir = "/etc/maradns"
csv2 = {}
csv2["example.com."] = "db.example.com"
</pre>

</ul>

In the above mararc file, MaraDNS has the IP 127.0.0.1, would look for
zone files in the directory <tt>/etc/maradns</tt>, and reads the file
db.example.com to get the zone for example.com. <p>

OK, so let's look at some problems, as they appear on a CentOS 3.8
box with the above mararc file.
<p>

This is how things look when we don't have a loopback interface to bind 
to.  Like in all examples in this guide, the '$' character indicates a 
line that we type data on; all other lines, including lines that start 
with '#', are lines created by the programs we are running in these 
examples.

<p>

<pre>
$ askmara Awww.example.com.
# Querying the server with the IP 127.0.0.1
# Hard Error: Unable to send UDP packet!
</pre>

Basically, the askmara client is unable to send a query because there
is no way for it to contact a server on 127.0.0.1.  Probably because
there is no 127.0.0.1 to send the packet on.

So, let's start troubleshooting. 

<pre>
$ export PATH=$PATH:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/sbin
</pre>

This gives us access to commands like ifconfig and what not.<p>

<tt>
$ su<br>
Password: </tt><i>type in your root password here</i><pre>
$ ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
$ askmara Awww.example.com.
# Querying the server with the IP 127.0.0.1
# Hard Error: Timeout
</pre>

OK, so let's restart MaraDNS:

<pre>
$ /etc/rc.d/init.d/maradns restart
Sending all MaraDNS processes the TERM signal
waiting 1 second
Sending all MaraDNS processes the KILL signal
MaraDNS should have been stopped
Starting all maradns processes
Starting maradns process which uses Mararc file /etc/mararc
</pre>

If <tt>/etc/rc.d/init.d/maradns restart</tt> doesn't generate the above
output, this indicates that either MaraDNS was not correctly installed,
or that you are using MaraDNS on another Linux/*NIX distribution.  If
you're not using CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux, replace this
command with the appropriate command for restarting a daemon/service for
your operating system. <p>

Now, the dhclient that CentOS 3.8 comes with is buggy, and breaks lo
(the loopback interface which gives CentOS the 127.0.0.1 IP address).
So, we have to fix lo again:

<pre>
$ ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
</pre>

In addition, losing 127.0.0.1 breaks any service bound to 127.0.0.1,
such as MaraDNS, so we have to rebind MaraDNS to 127.0.0.1:

<pre>
$ /etc/rc.d/init.d/maradns restart
Sending all MaraDNS processes the TERM signal
waiting 1 second
Sending all MaraDNS processes the KILL signal
MaraDNS should have been stopped
Starting all maradns processes
Starting maradns process which uses Mararc file /etc/mararc
</pre>

Keep in mind that MaraDNS binds to high-numbered ports when sending
outgoing DNS requests.  The "Firewall Configuration" section of the <A
href=man.maradns.html>MaraDNS man page</A> gives details.

<p>

The problem with UNIX firewalls is that there is no standard interface
for configuring them, so I can't help you as well as I would like here.
CentOS 3.8, by default, has a firewall that allows MaraDNS to act as a
recursive nameserver on the loopback (127.0.0.1) interface, but the
firewall needs to be changed to work on other interfaces:

<pre>
$ redhat-config-securitylevel-tui
</pre>

And select "personalize", and add "53:udp" as a hole in the firewall.
Yes, the interface for this program is somewhat primitive; hopefully
CentOS 4 has a more complete interface.

<p>

You will have to do a similar configuration change to any firewalls
between your server and the internet.

<h2>Timeout</h2>

It is also possible to get a timeout after sending an askmara query.
A timeout looks like this:

<pre>
$ askmara Awww.google.com.
# Querying the server with the IP 127.0.0.1
</pre>

At this point, there is a 30 second delay.  After the delay, askmara
outputs this message:

<pre>
# Hard Error: Timeout
</pre>

This is usually caused by one of two problems:

<ul>
<li>Maradns is not correctly running
<li>A firewall is stopping DNS packets from being sent over the 
    loopback interface
</ul>

To see if MaraDNS is running, run ps like this:

<pre>
$ ps auxw | grep maradns
</pre>

If MaraDNS is running, the output will look like this:

<pre>
root      2023  0.0  0.0  1516  304 pts/1    S    11:46   0:00 /usr/bin/duende 
/usr/sbin/maradns -f /etc/mararc
nobody    2024  0.3  0.1  1748  596 pts/1    S    11:46   0:00 /usr/sbin/maradns
 -f /etc/mararc
#66       2025  0.0  0.0  1520  440 pts/1    S    11:46   0:00 /usr/bin/duende 
/usr/sbin/maradns -f /etc/mararc
user      2027  0.0  0.1  3720  700 pts/1    S    11:46   0:00 grep maradns
</pre>

If MaraDNS is not running, the output will look like this:

<pre>
user      1983  0.0  0.1  3728  696 pts/1    S    11:45   0:00 grep maradns
</pre>

<p>

If MaraDNS is not running, there may be a message in the log files
indicating why MaraDNS failed when you tried to start MaraDNS.  Look
at the log:

<pre>
$ su
Password:
$ grep maradns /var/log/messages | more
</pre>

The messages will give you a hint as to what is preventing MaraDNS
from starting up.  If there are no MaraDNS messages in your log, there is
something wrong with your MaraDNS installation.  

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Basically, the best strategy for troubleshooting problems with MaraDNS is
to have the mararc file be a simple three line mararc file.  If things
still don't work, the problem is probably outside of MaraDNS.
