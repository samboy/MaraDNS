   One of the things that is very delightful about writing
   open-source software is the incredible amount of help people
   have been offering me with MaraDNS. Numerous people have
   provided invaluable assistance with filing bug reports,
   making usability suggestions, providing patches and reports
   with respect to running MaraDNS on other operating systems,
   and otherwise making MaraDNS a superior program.

   Here is a partial list of people who have provided
   assistance:

   Floh has generously set up a FreeBSD 4, FreeBSD 6, and Mac OS
   X system so that I can port MaraDNS to more platforms.

   Albert Lee has provided countless bug reports, and, nicely
   enough, patches to fix said bugs. He has also made
   improvements to the code in the tcp "zoneserver".

   Franky Van Liedekerke has provided much invaluable
   assistance. As just one example, he provided invaluable
   assistance in getting MaraDNS to compile on Solaris. In
   addition, he has provided much valuable SQA help.

   Christian Kurz, who has provided invaluable bug reports,
   especially when I had to re-implement the core hashing
   algorithm.

   Remmy, who is providing both the web space and a mailing list
   for maradns.org.

   Phil Homewood, who provided invaluable assistance with
   finding and fixing bugs in the authoritative portion of the
   MaraDNS server. He helped me plug memory leaks, find
   uninitialized variables being used, and found a number of
   bugs I was unable to find.

   Albert Prats kindly provided Spanish translations for various
   text files.

   Shin Zukeran provided a patch to recursive.c which properly
   makes a normal null-terminated string from a js_string
   object, to send as an argument to open() so we can get the
   rijndael key for the PRNG.

   D Richard Felker III has provided invaluable bug reports. By
   looking at his bug reports, I have been able to hunt down and
   fix many problems that the recursive nameserver had, in
   addition to at least one problem with the authoritative
   nameserver.

   Ole Tange has also given me many valuable MaraDNS bug
   reports.

   Florin Iucha provided a tip in the FAQ for how to compile
   MaraDNS on OpenBSD.

   Roy Arends (one of the BIND developers, as it turns out)
   found a serious security problem with MaraDNS, where MaraDNS
   would answer answers, and pointed it out to me.

   Code used as the basis for the psudo-random-number generator
   was written by Vincent Rijmen, Antoon Bosselaers, and Paulo
   Barreto. I appreciate these programmers making the code
   public domain, which is the only license under which I can
   add code to MaraDNS under.

   Ross Johnson and others have made a Win32 port of the
   Pthreads library; this has made a native win32 port of
   MaraDNS possible.

   I also appreciate the work of Dr. Brian Gladman and Fritz
   Schneider, who have both written independent implementations
   of AES from which I obtained test vectors. With the help of
   their hard work, I was able to discover a subtle security
   problem that previous releases of MaraDNS had.
