# Example mararc file. 
# This only shows a subset of MaraDNS' features needed to be an
# authoritative name server.  Look at 
# detailed/example_full_mararc for an example showing most of 
# the features that MaraDNS has.

# Note that this example mararc file will not actually do anything
# without modification.
# Look in the doc/en/examples directory for a working example 
# authoritative nameserver, and a working recursive nameserver.

# The various zones we support

# When running in authoritative mode, we must initialize the csv2 hash, 
# or MaraDNS will be unable to load any csv2 zone files
csv2 = {}

# This is just to show the format of the file
# Note the this is commented out.  Any line that starts with 
# a '#' is not read by the parser.  Remove the leading '#' to 
# enable any line that is commented out

# The following line (commented out) tells MaraDNS to look at the 
# file db.example.net to get the zone for example.net
csv2["example.net."] = "db.example.net"
# Naturally, we can have multiple zone files
#csv2["example.com."] = "db.example.com"

# The address this DNS server runs on.  If you want to bind 
# to multiple addresses, separate them with a comma like this:
# "10.1.2.3, 10.1.2.4, 127.0.0.1"
ipv4_bind_addresses = "127.0.0.1"
# The directory with all of the zone files
