.SH "NAME"
.PP
zoneserver - handle zone transfers and other TCP functions for MaraDNS
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.B "zoneserver"
listens on port 53/tcp and handles DNS zone transfers
and any DNS query done over TCP instead of UDP.
.B "zoneserver"
uses a configuration file,
.B "/etc/mararc"
by default, to determine its parameters.
.SH "USAGE"
.PP
.B "zoneserver -f"
pointer_to_mararc_file
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.TP 4
-f
Specifies the location of the configuration file. MaraDNS uses the same
configuration file for both the main dns server and the zoneserver.
.PP
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The file format for the mararc file can be found in the
.B "mararc(5)"
manual page. In particular, the zoneserver uses the
zone_transfer_acl, tcp_convert_acl, tcp_convert_server, and
bind_address
mararc parameters.
.SH "EXAMPLE MARARC FILE"
.PP
In this example mararc file, which is used both by maradns and
zoneserver,
we allow 10.1.2.3, 10.1.14.7, and 192.168.116.{any} to transfer zones,
and
we allow anyone on the internet to perform TCP queries. The only zone
served in this example is example.com:

.nf
ipv4_bind_addresses = "10.1.1.1" # Our IP
tcp_convert_server = "10.1.1.1" # IP of UDP DNS server
tcp_convert_acl = "0.0.0.0/0" # Anyone may do DNS-over-TCP
chroot_dir = "/etc/maradns" # Where zone files are
csv2 = {} # Initialize list of zone files
csv2["example.com."] = "db.example.com" # example.com zone file
# The next line is a list of who can transfer zones from us
zone_transfer_acl = "10.1.2.3, 10.1.14.7, 192,168.116.0/24"
.fi

.SH "BUGS"
.PP
.B "zoneserver"
assumes that the authoritative NS records are immediately after the SOA
record, and that there is at least one non-NS between that last
authority
NS record for the zone and the first delegation NS record.
.PP
IXFR requests are incremental zone transfers, meaning that the DNS
server should only display records changed since the last IXFR request.
.BR "zoneserver" ","
however, treats an IXFR as if it were an AXFR request, outputting all
of
the records for the zone in question.
.PP
.B "zoneserver"
closes the TCP connection after transferring the requested zone.
.PP
If an unauthorized client attempts to connect to the zoneserver,
.B "zoneserver"
immediately disconnects the unauthorized client.
