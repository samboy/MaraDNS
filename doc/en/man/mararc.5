.SH "NAME"
.PP
mararc - Format of the mararc zone file that MaraDNS uses
.SH "MARARC FILE FORMAT"
.PP
Mararc files use a syntax that is a subset of Python 2.2.3 syntax. In
particular, Python 2.2.3 (and possibly other versions of Python) can
read
a properly formatted mararc file without error.
.PP
Unlike Python, however, a mararc file can only use certain variable
names,
and the variables can only be declared as described below.
.PP
.SH "COMMENTS"
.PP
Comments (lines ignored by the MaraDNS parser) start with the \(aq#\(aq
character, like this:

.nf
# This is a comment
.fi

The MaraDNS parser also ignores lines which contain only white space.
.SH "OPERATORS"
.PP
The MaraRC file supports two operators: = and +=
.PP
The = operator can be used to assign both numeric and string values
.PP
The += operator can only be used on string values, and concatenates the
value to the right of the += operator to the string specified to the
left of the += operator.
.PP
Examples:

.nf
ipv4_bind_addresses = "10.2.19.83"
ipv4_bind_addresses += ",10.2.66.74"
ipv4_bind_addresses += ",10.3.87.13"
.fi

ipv4_bind_addresses now has the value
"10.2.19.83,10.2.66.74,10.3.87.13"

.nf
ipv4_alias["icann"] = "198.41.0.4"
ipv4_alias["icann"] += ",192.228.79.201"
ipv4_alias["icann"] += ",192.33.4.12,128.8.10.90"
.fi

.SH "MARARC VARIABLES"
.PP
Follows is a listing of variables that can be declared in the mararc
file.
.SH "DICTIONARY VARIABLE FORMAT"
.PP
A
.B "dictionary variable"
is an array that can have multiple elements. Unlike a traditional
array, these arrays are indexed by strings instead of numbers. These
are analogous to associative arrays, or what Perl somewhat inaccurately
calls hashes.
.PP
The syntax of a dictionary variable is in the following form:

.nf
name["index"] = "value"
.fi

Where
.B "name"
is the name of the dictionary variable,
.B "index"
is the index of the array, and
.B "value"
is the value stored at that index.
.PP
Every time we have a dictionary-type variable (such as csv2),
we must first initialize it using a line in the following form:

.nf
csv2 = {}
.fi

Here, csv2 is the name of the "dictionary" variable that we are
initializing.
.SH "DICTIONARY VARIABLES"
.PP
Here is a listing of all "dictionary"-style variables that MaraDNS
uses:
.PP
.in -3
\fBcsv2\fR
.PP
The csv2 dictionary variable stores all of the zone names and file
names
for the zone files that MaraDNS uses. Note that csv2 files are read
after MaraDNS is chrooted. Hence the filename is relative to the
chroot_dir.
Example:

.nf
csv2["example.net."] = "db.example.net"
.fi

See
.B "csv2(5)"
for a description of this file\(aqs format.
.PP
The dictionary index (zone name) can not have a * in it. If it does,
MaraDNS will terminate with an "Illegal zone name" error.
.PP
.in -3
\fBcsv1\fR
.PP
csv1: Used to indicate the filename to use for a given zone stored in
the legacy csv1 zone file format. This is primarily for compatibility
with people who have maradns-1.0 zone files.

.nf
csv1["zone"] = "filename"
.fi

.BR "csv1" ":"
A pipe-separated-file. See
.BR "csv1(5)" "."
.PP
.BR "zone" ":"
the zone that file in question is authoritative for
.PP
.BR "filename" ":"
the file with the CSV1 zone data
.PP
Note that csv1 files are read after MaraDNS is chrooted, and,
hence the filename is relative to the chroot_dir.
.PP
See the
.B "csv1(5)"
man page for more information on this file format.
.PP
.in -3
\fBipv4_alias\fR
.PP
ipv4_alias: Used to give nicknames or aliases for ip/netmask
pairs for ipv4 (standard 32-bit) IP addresses.

.nf
ipv4_alias["name"] = "ip1/netmask,ip2/netmask,etc"
.fi

.BR "name" ":"
The name of the alias in question
.PP
.BR "ip" ":"
The ip portion of an ip/netmask pair
.PP
.BR "netmask" ":"
the mask portion of an ip/netmask pair
.PP
.BR "," ":"
Used to separate ip/netmask pairs. Spaces may be placed before or
after this comma.
.PP
An ip is in dotted-decimal format, e.g. "10.1.2.3".
.PP
The netmask can be in one of two formats: A single number between
1 and 32, which indicates the number of leading "1" bits in the
netmask, or a 4-digit dotted-decimal netmask.
.PP
The netmask is used to specify a range of IPs.
.PP
.PP
.in -3
\fBipv4_alias examples\fR
.PP
.B "10.1.1.1/24"
indicates that any ip from 10.1.1.0 to 10.1.1.255
will match.
.PP
.B "10.1.1.1/255.255.255.0"
is identical to 10.1.1.1/24
.PP
.B "10.2.3.4/16"
indicates that any ip from 10.2.0.0 to 10.2.255.255
will match.
.PP
.B "10.2.3.4/255.255.0.0"
is identical to 10.2.3.4/16
.PP
.B "127.0.0.0/8"
indicates that any ip with "127" as the first
octet (number) will match.
.PP
.B "127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0"
is identical to 127.0.0.0/8
.PP
The netmask is optional, and, if not present, indicates that only
a single IP will "match". e.g:
.PP
.BR "10.9.9.9/32" ","
.BR "10.9.9.9/255.255.255.255" ","
and
.B "10.9.9.9"
are all functionally identical, and indicate that only the ip 10.9.9.9
will match.
.PP
The significance of "match" depends on what we use the ipv4
alias for.
.PP
ipv4 aliases can nest. E.g:

.nf
ipv4_alias["susan"] = "10.6.7.8/24" 
ipv4_alias["office"] = "susan,10.9.9.9"
.fi

Where "susan" in the "office" alias matches the value of the
ipv4_alias susan.
.PP
Multiple levels of nesting are allowed. Self-referring nests will
result in an error.
.PP
.SH "NORMAL VARIABLE FORMAT"
.PP
Normal variables. These are variables that can only take
a single value.
.PP
The syntax of a normal variable is in the form

.nf
name = "value"
.fi

Where
.B "name"
is the name of the normal variable, and
.B "value"
is the value of the variable in question.
.SH "NORMAL VARIABLES"
.PP
Here is a listing of normal variables that MaraDNS
uses:
.PP
.in -3
\fBipv4_bind_addresses\fR
.PP
ipv4_bind_addresses: The IP addresses to give the MaraDNS server.
.PP
This accepts one or more ipv4 IPs in dotted-decimal (e.g. "127.0.0.1")
notation, and specifies what IP addresses the MaraDNS server will
listen on. Multiple bind addresses are separated with a comma, like
this: "10.1.2.3, 10.1.2.4, 127.0.0.1"
.PP
.PP
.in -3
\fBadmin_acl\fR
.PP
This is a list of ip/netmask pairs that are allowed to get certain
administrative information about MaraDNS, including:
.TP 2
*
The version number of MaraDNS running
.TP 2
*
The number of threads MaraDNS has
.TP 2
*
MaraDNS\(aq internal timestamp value
.PP
Note that this information is not available unless
the mararc variable debug_msg_level is sufficiently high.
See the information on debug_msg_level below for details on this
and on the TXT queries sent to get the above information.
.PP
.in -3
\fBbind_address\fR
.PP
bind_address: The IP address to give the MaraDNS server.
.PP
This accepts a single IP in dotted-decimal (e.g. "127.0.0.1")
notation, and specifies what IP address the MaraDNS server will
listen on. Note that ipv4_bind_addresses has the same functionality.
This name is included so that old MaraDNS configuration files will
continue to work with new MaraDNS releases.
.PP
.PP
.in -3
\fBbind_star_handling\fR
.PP
In the case where there is both a star record for a given name and
recordtype,
a non-star record with the same name but a different recordtype, and no
record
for the given name and recordtype, MaraDNS will usually return the
star record. BIND, on the other hand, will return a "not there" reply.
In other words:
.TP 2
*
If a non-A record for foo.example.com exists
.TP 2
*
An A record for *.example.com exists
.TP 2
*
No A record for foo.example.com exists
.TP 2
*
And the user asks for the A record for foo.example.com
.TP 2
*
MaraDNS will usually return the A record attached to *.example.com
.TP 2
*
BIND, on the other hand, returns a "not there" for foo.example.com
.PP
If the BIND behavior is desired, set bind_star_handling to 1.
Otherwise, set this to 0. In MaraDNS 1.3, this has a default value of
1.
.PP
In addition, if there is a star record that could match any given
record
type, when bind_star_handling is 1, it makes sure that MaraDNS
does not incorrectly return a NXDOMAIN (RFC 4074 section 4.2).
.PP
Also, if bind_star_handling has a value of 2, MaraDNS will handle
the following case exactly as per section 4.3.3 of RFC1034:
.TP 2
*
If a record for foo.example.com exists
.TP 2
*
An A record for *.example.com exists
.TP 2
*
And the user asks for the A record for bar.foo.example.com
.TP 2
*
MaraDNS will usually return the A record attached to *.example.com
.TP 2
*
RFC1034 section 4.3.3 says one should return a NXDOMAIN.
.PP
MaraDNS will exit with a fatal error if bind_star_handling has
any value besides 0, 1, or 2.
.PP
.in -3
\fBchroot_dir\fR
.PP
chroot_dir: The directory MaraDNS chroots to
.PP
This accepts a single value: The full path to the directory to
use as a chroot jail.
.PP
Note that csv1 zone files are read after the chroot operation.
Hence, the chroot jail needs to have any and all zone files that
MaraDNS will load.
.PP
.in -3
\fBcsv2_default_zonefile\fR
.PP
This is a special zone file that allows there to be stars at the
.I "end"
of hostnames. This file is similar to a normal csv2 zone file, but has
the following features and limitations:
.TP 2
*
Stars are allowed at the end of hostnames
.TP 2
*
A SOA record is mandatory
.TP 2
*
NS records are mandatory
.TP 2
*
Neither CNAME, FQDN4, nor FQDN6 records are permitted in the zone
file
.TP 2
*
Delegation NS records are not permitted in the zone file
.TP 2
*
Default zonefiles may not be transferred via zone transfer
.TP 2
*
Both recursion and default zonefiles may not be enabled at the same
time
.PP
.PP
.in -3
\fBcsv2_synthip_list\fR
.PP
Sometimes the IP list of nameservers will be different than the
nameservers one is bound to. This allows the synthetic nameserver list
to have different IPs.
.PP
Note that this may act in an unexpected manner
if routable and non-routable (localhost and RFC1918) addresses are
combined; in particular, a list with both routable and non-routable
addresses will discard the non-routable IP addresses, and a list with
rfc1918 and localhost addresses will discard the localhost addresses.
.PP
.in -3
\fBcsv2_tilde_handling\fR
.PP
How the csv2 zone file parser handles tildes (the ~ character) in csv2
zone files. This is a numeric record, with a possible value between 0
and 3 (four possible values). The way the csv2 parser acts at different
csv2_tilde_handling levels:
.TP 2
*
0) The csv2 parser behaves the same as it does in old MaraDNS releases:
The tilde has no special significance to the parser.
.TP 2
*
1) A tilde is not allowed anywhere in a csv2 zone file.
.TP 2
*
2) A tilde is only allowed between records in a csv2 zone file. If
a tilde is between the first record and the second record, a tilde
is required to be between all records. Otherwise, a tilde is not
allowed
anywhere in a csv2 zone file. The first record can not
be a TXT, WKS, or LOC record.
.TP 2
*
3) A tilde is required to be between all records in a csv2 zone file.
.PP
The default value for csv2_tilde_handling is 2; this allows
compatibility
with older zone files without tildes while allowing zone files to be
updated to use the tilde to separate resource records.
.PP
.in -3
\fBdebug_msg_level\fR
.PP
This is a number indicating what level of information about a running
MaraDNS process should be made public. When set to 0, no information
will be made public.
.PP
When set to one (the default), or higher, a
Tversion.maradns. (TXT query for
"version.maradns.") query will return the version
number of MaraDNS.
.PP
When set to two or higher, a Tnumthreads.maradns.
(TXT query for "numthreads.maradns.")
query will return the
number of threads that MaraDNS is currently running, and a
Tcache-elements.maradns.
query will return the number of elements in MaraDNS\(aq cache.
.PP
If MaraDNS is compiled with debugging information on, a
Tmemusage.maradns. query will return the amount of memory MaraDNS has
allocated. Note that the overhead for tracking memory usage is
considerable
and that compiling MaraDNS with "make debug" will greatly slow down
MaraDNS.
A debug build of MaraDNS is
.B "not"
recommended for production use.
.PP
When set to three or higher, a Ttimestamp.maradns. query will return,
in
seconds since the UNIX epoch, the timestamp for the system MaraDNS
is running on.

.br
.PP
.in -3
\fBdefault_rrany_set\fR
.PP
This variable used to determine what kind of resource records were
returned
when an ANY query was sent. In MaraDNS, the data structures have since
been
revised to return any resource record type when an ANY query is sent;
this
variable does nothing, and is only here so that old MaraDNS mararc
files
will continue to work.
The only accepted values for this variable were 3 and 15.
.PP
.in -3
\fBdns_port\fR
.PP
This is the port that MaraDNS listens on. This is usually 53 (the
default value), but certain unusual MaraDNS setups (such as when
resolving
dangling CNAME records on but a single IP) may need to have a different
value for this.
.PP
.in -3
\fBdos_protection_level\fR
.PP
If this is set to a non-zero value, certain features of MaraDNS will be
disabled in order to speed up MaraDNS\(aq response time. This is
designed for
situations when a MaraDNS server is receiving a large number of
queries,
such as during a denial of service attack.
.PP
This is a numeric variable; its default value is zero, indicating that
all
of MaraDNS\(aq normal features are enabled. Higher numeric values
disable more features:
.TP 2
*
A dos_protection_level between 1 and 78 (inclusive) disables getting
MaraDNS status information remotely.
.TP 2
*
A dos_protection_level of 8 or above disables CNAME lookups.
.TP 2
*
A dos_protection_level or 12 or above disables delegation NS records.
.TP 2
*
A dos_protection_level of 14 or above disables ANY record processing.
.TP 2
*
A dos_protection_level of 18 or above disables star record processing
at the beginning of hostnames (default zonefiles still work, however).
.TP 2
*
A dos_protection_level of 78 disables all authoritative processing,
including default zonefiles.
.PP
The default level of dos_protection_level is 0 when there are one or
more
zonefiles; 78 when there are no zone files.
.PP
.in -3
\fBipv6_bind_address\fR
.PP
If MaraDNS is compiled with as an authoritative server, then this
variable will tell MaraDNS which ipv6 address for the UDP server to;
for this variable to be set, MaraDNS must be bound to at least one
ipv4 address.
.PP
.in -3
\fBhide_disclaimer\fR
.PP
If this is set to "YES", MaraDNS will not display the legal disclaimer
when
starting up.
.PP
.in -3
\fBlong_packet_ipv4\fR
.PP
This is a list of IPs which we will send UDP packets longer than the
512 bytes
RFC1035 permits if necessary. This is designed to allow zoneserver,
when used send regular DNS packets over TCP, to receive packets with
more
data than can fit in a 512-byte DNS packet.
.PP
This variable only functions if MaraDNS is compiled as an authoritative
only server.
.PP
.in -3
\fBmaradns_uid\fR
.PP
maradns_uid: The numeric UID that MaraDNS will run as
.PP
This accepts a single numerical value: The UID to run MaraDNS as.
.PP
MaraDNS, as soon as possible drops root privileges, minimizing the
damage a potential attacker can cause should there be a security
problem with MaraDNS. This is the UID maradns becomes.
.PP
The default UID is 707.
.PP
.in -3
\fBmaradns_gid\fR
.PP
maradns_gid: The numeric GID that MaraDNS will run as.
.PP
This accepts a single numerical value: The GID to run MaraDNS as.
.PP
The default GID is 707.
.PP
.in -3
\fBmax_ar_chain\fR
.PP
max_ar_chain: The maximum number of records to display if a record in
the additional section (e.g., the IP of a NS server
or the ip of a MX exchange) has more than one value.
.PP
This is similar to max_chain, but applies to records in the
"additional" (or AR) section.
.PP
Due to limitations in the internal data structures that MaraDNS
uses to store RRs, if this has a value besides one, round robin
rotates of records are disabled.
.PP
The default value for this variable is 1.
.PP
.in -3
\fBmax_chain\fR
.PP
max_chain: The maximum number of records to display in a chain
of records.
.PP
With DNS, it is possible to have more than one RR for a given
domain label. For example, "example.com" can have, as the A record,
a list of multiple ip addresses.
.PP
This sets the maximum number of records MaraDNS will show for a
single RR.
.PP
MaraDNS normally round-robin rotates records. Hence, all records
for a given DNS label (e.g. "example.com.") will be visible,
although not at the same time if there are more records than the
value allowed with max_chain
.PP
The default value for this variable is 8.
.PP
.in -3
\fBmax_tcp_procs\fR
.PP
max_tcp_procs: The (optional) maximum number of processes the zone
server is allowed to run.
.PP
Sometimes, it is desirable to have a different number of maximum
allowed tcp processes than maximum allowed threads. If this
variable is not set, the maximum number of allowed tcp processes is
"maxprocs".
.PP
.in -3
\fBmax_total\fR
.PP
max_total: The maximum number of records to show total for a given
DNS request.
.PP
This is the maximum total number of records that MaraDNS will make
available in a DNS reply.
.PP
The default value for this variable is 20.
.PP
.in -3
\fBmax_mem\fR
.PP
max_mem is the maximum amount of memory we allow MaraDNS to allocate,
in bytes.
.PP
The default value of this is to allocate 2 megabytes for MaraDNS\(aq
general
use, and in addition, to allocate 3072 bytes for each element we
can have in the cache or DNS record that we are authoritatively
serving.
.PP
.in -3
\fBmin_visible_ttl\fR
.PP
min_visible_ttl: The minimum value that we will will show as the TTL
(time
to live) value for a resource record to other DNS servers and stub
resolvers.
In other words, this is the minimum value we will ask other DNS server
to
cache (keep in their memory) a DNS resource record.
.PP
The value is in seconds. The default value for this is 30; the minimum
value this can have is 5.
.PP
As an aside, RFC1123 section 6.1.2.1 implies that zero-length TTL
records
should be passed on with a TTL of zero. This, unfortunately, breaks
some
stub resolvers (such as Mozilla\(aqs stub resolver).
.PP
.in -3
\fBremote_admin\fR
.PP
remote_admin: Whether we allow verbose_level to be changed
after MaraDNS is started.
.PP
If remote_admin is set to 1, and admin_acl is set,
any and all IPs listed in admin_acl will be able to
reset the value of verbose_level from any value between 0
and 9 via a TXT query in the form of 5.verbose_level.maradns.
What this will do is set verbose_query to the value in the
first digit of the query.
.PP
This is useful when wishing to temporarily increase the
verbose_level to find out why a given host name is not
resolving, then decreasing verbose_level so as to minimize
the size of MaraDNS\(aq log.
.PP
.in -3
\fBsynth_soa_origin\fR
.PP
When a CSV2 zone file doesn\(aqt have a SOA record in it, MaraDNS
generates
a SOA record on the fly. This variable determines the host name for
the "SOA origin" (which is called the MNAME in RFC1035); this is the
host name of the DNS server which has the "master copy" of a given
DNS zone\(aqs file.
.PP
This host name is in human-readable format without a trailing dot,
e.g.:

.nf
synth_soa_origin = "ns1.example.com"
.fi

If this is not set, a synthetic SOA record will use the name of the
zone for the SOA origin (MNAME) field.
.PP
.PP
.in -3
\fBsynth_soa_serial\fR
.PP
This determines whether we strictly follow RFC1912 section 2.2 with
SOA serial numbers. If this is set to 1 (the default value), we do
not strictly follow RFC1912 section 2.2 (the serial is a number, based
on the timestamp of the zone file, that is updated every six seconds),
but
this makes it so that a serial number is guaranteed to be automatically
updated every time one edits a zone file.
.PP
If this is set to 2, the SOA serial number will be in YYYYMMDDHH
format,
where YYYY is the 4-digit year, MM is the 2-digit month, DD is the
2-digit
day, and HH is the 2-digit hour of the time the zone file was last
updated
(GMT; localtime doesn\(aqt work in a chroot() environment). While this
format is strictly RFC1912 compliant, the disadvantage is that more
than
one edit to a zone file in an hour will not update the serial number.
.PP
I strongly recommend, unless it is extremely important to have a
DNS zone that generates no warnings when tested at dnsreport.com, to
have
this set to 1 (the default value). Having this set to 2 can result in
updated zone files not being seen by slave DNS servers.
.PP
Note that synth_soa_serial can only have a value of 1 on the native
Windows port.
.PP
.in -3
\fBtcp_convert_acl\fR
.PP
This only applies to the zoneserver (general DNS-over-TCP) program.
.PP
This is a list of IPs which are allowed to connect to the zoneserver
and
send normal TCP DNS requests. The zoneserver will convert TCP DNS
requests in to UDP DNS requests, and send the UDP request in question
to the server specified in
.BR "tcp_convert_server" "."
Once it gets a
reply from the UDP DNS server, it will convert the reply in to a TCP
request and send the reply back to the original TCP client.
.PP
Whether the RD (recursion desired) flag is set or not when converting a
TCP
DNS request in to a UDP DNS request is determined by whether the TCP
client
is on the
.B "recursive_acl"
list. Since MaraDNS 2.0 does not have
recursion, the maradns daemon ignores the RD bit (Deadwood will not
process any queries without the RD bit set).
.PP
.in -3
\fBtcp_convert_server\fR
.PP
This only applies to the zoneserver (general DNS-over-TCP) program.
.PP
This is the UDP server which we send a query to when converting DNS TCP
queries in to DNS UDP servers. Note that, while this value allows
multiple IPs, all values except the first one are presently
ignored.
.PP
.in -3
\fBtimestamp_type\fR
.PP
timestamp_type: The type of timestamp to display. The main purpose of
this option is to suppress the output of timestamps. Since duende uses
syslog() to output data, and since syslog() adds its own timestamp,
this
option should be set to 5 when maradns is invoked with the duende tool.
.PP
This option also allows people who do not use the duende tool to view
human-readable timestamps. This option only allows timestamps in GMT,
due to issues with showing local times in a chroot() environment.
.PP
This can have the following values:
.TP 4
0
The string "Timestamp" followed by a UNIX timestamp
.TP 4
1
Just the bare UNIX timestamp
.TP 4
2
A GMT timestamp in the Spanish language
.TP 4
3
A (hopefully) local timestamp in the Spanish language
.TP 4
4
A timestamp using asctime(gmtime()); usually in the English language
.TP 4
5
No timestamp whatsoever is shown (this is the best option when
maradns is invoked with the duende tool).
.TP 4
6
ISO GMT timestamp is shown
.TP 4
7
ISO local timestamp is shown
.PP
.PP
The default value for this variable is 5.
.PP

.TP 4
0
No messages except for the legal disclaimer and fatal parsing errors
.TP 4
1
Only startup messages logged (Default level)
.TP 4

If one should declare the same the same index twice with
a dictionary variable, MaraDNS will exit with a fatal error. This is
because earlier versions of MaraDNS acted in a different manner than
Python 2.3.3. With Python 2.3.3, the last declaration is used, while
MaraDNS used to use the first declaration.
