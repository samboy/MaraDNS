.SH "NAME"
.PP
bind2csv2.py - convert zone files from BIND to MaraDNS compatible
format
.SH "DESCRPTION"
.PP
MaraDNS 1.3 has BIND zone file support. This means it is possible
to use BIND zone files in MaraDNS. This makes it easier for people to
use MaraDNS in mixed DNS server environments.
.PP
Instead of having direct BIND zone file support, MaraDNS has a script,
called bind2csv2.py, that converts BIND zone files in to
the "csv2" zone file format that MaraDNS 1.2 and 1.3 use. The zone
files generated by bind2csv2.py are
.I "not"
MaraDNS 1.2
compatible; MaraDNS 1.3 is needed to read zone files generated by
bind2csv2.py.
.PP
bind2csv2.py is a Python script, written in version 2.2.3
of the Python interpreter. The script
.I "should"
be compatible
with more recent versions of Python. The script assumes Python
is the file /usr/bin/python on your system; if Python is
located elsewhere on your system, please change the first line
of bind2csv2.py. Naturally, you will need the Python
interpreter installed on your system to use bind2csv2.py.
This is a well-known open source language supported by most modern
Linux and BSD distributions.
.SH "USAGE"
.PP
To use the script, enter a directory containing BIND
zone files, and invoke the script thusly:

.nf
bind2csv2.py -c zone1 zone2 zone3
.fi

Substitute "zone1", "zone2", and "zone3" with a list of one or more
BIND zone files you wish be converted in to MaraDNS 1.3 csv2 zone
files.
.PP
Once the script is run, you should have files with names like
"zone1.csv2", "zone2.csv2", and "zone3.csv2". These files are csv2
zone files that MaraDNS will be able to parse. Copy these csv2 zone
files to a place where MaraDNS can find the zone files.
.PP
Should there already be a "zone1.csv2" file when bind2csv2.py
is run, the "zone1.csv2" file will be replaced.
.PP
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
None. Bind2csv2.py can only be used as above.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
bind2csv2.py is not a perfect zone file converter. In
particular, bind2csv2.py does not act like BIND when NS records
have different TTLs. Please make sure all NS records in your BIND zone
files have the same TTL.
.PP
In addition, bind2csv2.py also does not support
all resource record types that BIND supports. Only the following RRs
are supported by bind2csv2.py:
A
AAAA
AFSDB
CNAME
GPOS
HINFO
ISDN
LOC
MB
MD
MF
MG
MINFO
MR
MX
NS
NSAP
PTR
