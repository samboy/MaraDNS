<li>Vlatko Kosturjak from Croatia has added <tt>chkconfig</tt> support
    to the RPM spec file.
<li>Documentation on making MaraDNS a Win32 service added.
<li>Truncation of records too long to fit in a 512-byte packet now done 
    in a RFC2181-compliant manner.
<li>Slash commands added to csv2 zone files: '/serial', which allows the
    serial for a zone file to be automatically updated whenever the zone 
    file is edited; '/ttl', which allows the default TTL to be changed;
    '/origin', which allows the origin to be changed; '/opush' and '/opop'
    which allow the origin's values to be put on a stack; and '/read',
    which allows another file to be included in a zonefile.
<li>Some tidying of the Csv2 parsing code to deallocate unneeded memory
    resources; this should lower MaraDNS memory usage when a large number
    of csv2 zone files exist.
<li>Records stored in the authoritative half are now always marked
    "authoritative" in the DNS header; records not in a zone will simply
    not have NS records in the NS/AR section of the answer.

<p>maradns-1.2.03.1:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue with ANY queries pointed out by Christian Klossek.
<li>Made <tt>bind_star_handling</tt> even more RFC-compliant: If 
    <tt>*.example.com.</tt> and <tt>bar.example.com.</tt> exist,
    then <tt>foo.bar.example.com.</tt> should point to "not there" 
    instead of whatever <tt>*.example.com</tt> points at.
<li>Updated mingw32 port: Removed compile-time warnings, set up scripts
    to mostly automate making the .zip file for the win32 MaraDNS binary.
<li>Updated numbering scheme to use major.minor.revision.patchlevel
    for stable 1.2 releases; this allows the 1.2 branch to better have
    both a testing and a stable branch.
</ul>
(2006.01.21)
</blockquote>

<p>maradns-1.2.02:
This is a beta-test potentially unstable release, since the changes 
are significant enough to warrant full testing before declaring this
as stable as previous 1.2 releases of MaraDNS.
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Changed build process to have consistent compile-time flags in
    all directories, and to allow people on unsupported platforms to
    compile MaraDNS after they look at obnoxious error message.
<li>Fixed all of the compile-time warnings this change brought out.
<li>Added a new mararc variable, <tt>bind_star_handling</tt> for people
    who want full BIND compatibility with star records.
<li>Documentation updates: <tt>bind_star_handling</tt> documented, 
    <tt>SOURCE.FILES</tt> made current.
<li>Copyright notice updated for 2006
<li>.gz tarball now optimized by Igor Pavlov and Andrea Mazzoleni's 
    <tt>advdef</tt> program; this reduces size of .gz tarball by about 5%
</ul>
(2006.01.02)
</blockquote>

<p>maradns-1.2.01:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added script that will (mostly) automatically explode the tarball of
    the last release of MaraDNS, apply the patches, update the doc, and
    make the patches part of the 1.2 release.
<li>Updated dangling CNAME document to clarify that typos can also cause
    the dangling CNAME warning.
<li>Updated the tarball building process of MaraDNS to also use Igor
    Pavlov's LZMA compression to make a compressed MaraDNS tarball which 
    is both smaller and extracts faster than the bzip2 tarball.
<li>Fixed spurious dangling CNAME warning bug which Alex Kapranoff found.

This is the new stable release of MaraDNS, which is an update of the 1.0

December 21, 2007; critical security fixes, should they occur, will be
applied to the 1.0 branch until December 21, 2010.
<p>
Here are the changes from 1.1.91:
<ul>
<li>A small change to <tt>dns/Decompress.c</tt> so that MaraDNS runs on
    the compiler that comes with the IBM Power version of SuSE.
<li>Minor corrections to the FAQ
<li>BINDFAIL message no longer says that there's probably another process
    using port 53; there are a number of things that can trigger this error
    message and the "System said" message usually explains what's really
    going on.
<li>Pointed out that Macintosh-style newlines break the csv2 parser's
    ability to tell the user what line the error is on (This should generally
    not be a practical issue, since it is uncommon for people to use this
    text file format; it's too close to 1.2.00 to fix this).
<li>Update to the ej2man script so we don't have a raw accented character
    in the maradns man page (we use the ROFF \('a instead)

<li>Updated "unsupported features" part of MaraDNS man page to point out
    that 1.2 now supports more non-RFC1035 DNS features
<li>Plain text documents in a more easily found directory (doc/en/text
    instead of doc/en/tutorial/text).

    <tt>styleswitcher.js</tt> file so that people who need a large
    font to read a web page can get the large font with just one click.
<li>Updated the authoritative and recursive tutorial documents to cover the
    case of wanting a recursive name server to have private host names.
<li>Explicitly tell the user /etc/mararc is not being replaced during make
    install process.
<li>Updated the FAQ for version 1.2 of MaraDNS.
<li>Split up the DNS introduction document and the list of all tutorials,
    usage guides, and man pages.
<li>Added makefile in webpage document (now I have a one-command way of 
    updating the MaraDNS webpage).

    content with no hi-bit
    characters (such as man pages, which don't take well to non-ASCII)

<li>Web design touch-up: The web page is now centered (I found the code
    to force Firefox to always have a scrollbar like IE); looks better in
    MacIE/IE4/Opera 5; the handheld and printing stylesheets look better.
<li>Cleanup of install script; csv2 zone file installed instead of csv1 
    zone file; etc.
<li>Cleanup and clarification of default mararc file
<li>Changed makefile in rng/ to keep the rng-32bit-tables.h file; this
    will make things easier for people trying to cross-compile MaraDNS
<li>Made MaraDNS' default UID, GID, logger UID, and Duende chroot() directory
    defined near the beginning of MaraDns.h; this will make it easier for
    packagers to redefine these constants.
<li>Fixed zoneserver to have enough default values so that it works with
    the included example mararc.
<li>Fixed bugs in the serving of long packets over TCP; MaraDNS can now
    serve long DNS packets over TCP, breaking the 512-byte limit.
<li>askmara now correctly outputs multi-chunk TXT records (unless called with
    -v)
<li>Two new mararc varables added: <tt>synth_soa_origin</tt> and 
    <tt>synth_soa_serial</tt>.  These are here mainly so that people
    who test MaraDNS 1.2 domains over at dnsreport.com can have a

<p>maradns-1.1.49:

<ul>
<li>Revised pages on the web page to have a minimum number of HTML errors.

<li>Added a new feature, <tt>long_packet_ipv4</tt>, which will allow packets
    longer then 512 bytes long (compressed) to be sent from MaraDNS via
    TCP (we have a list of IPs which we can send UDP packets longer than 512
    bytes to; <tt>zoneserver</tt> translates these packets to
    standards-conforming TCP packets).  This is only enabled if MaraDNS
    is compiled as an authoritative-only nameserver.
<li>MaraDNS now generates no warning when compiled with GCC 3.4.2 as both
    an authoritative-only nameserver and as a recursive nameserver.
<li>MaraDNS, when compiled as an authoritative-only nameserver, now compiles
    with the name maradns.authonly.  The install and startup scripts have 
    been revised to reflect this change.
<li>Tutorial for doing DNS over TCP has been created.

<li>Made sure dnames are converted to lowercase before being put in to
  the bighash

  zone files.
<li>Moved TTL in fetchzone and askmara to be before the rtype.

</blockquote>

<p>maradns-1.0.19:
<blockquote>
This is a test release which addresses a number of issues people on the 
list have brought up:
<ul>
<li> Doug Sampson a pointed out that the server gives out compression errors
    and freezes.  I have replaced the compression code with the cleaner
    compression code from the 1.1.xx branch; this will hopefully address
    this issue.
<li> Andrew pointed out that the zoneserver does not give out adequate
    error messages when there is a problem opening up a zone file, or when
    there is a fatal parse error in a zone file.  I have added appropriate
    error messages to the zone server.
<li>Juergen Daubert provided a patch to make Mara's compile generate less
    warnings.  
<li>A problem with the ORSC entries being out of date was brought up.  I can
    not look up the current entries (being offline), but have changed all of
    the example files to use the ICANN entries by default, since ICANN is 
    the only root server registry who has root servers with stable enough 
    IPs for "set and forget" environments.
<li>I myself found some problems where timeouts for PTR and AAAA queries can
    slow down poorly-written clients.  As a result, MaraDNS now has the
    ability to optionally instantly give dummy "not there" replies to 
    either PTR or AAAA queries (or both).
<li>Some minor updates and clean-up to the documentation.
</ul>
(2003.08.03)

<p>maradns-1.1.17:
<blockquote>
Recursive queries now work again; fixed a place which was using a 32-bit
value to get a timestamp, when the code in question should have used a
josa_timestamp (64-bit) value.
<p>
Additionally, it is now possible to use this program as a non-root user
again.

Strnlen seems to not be a portable call after all (the BSDs don't have it);

<p>maradns-1.0.16:

This is MaraDNS 1.0.15 declared "stable" (well, as stable as 1.0.13).  The

This is MaraDNS 1.0.14 with a good deal more stress testing done to

leaks; nor are there any stability issues with this release of MaraDNS.
That said, I am, at present, marking the release "beta" until there is
more field testing of the release.

<p>maradns-1.0.14:

This is not a production release of MaraDNS.  This is a beta-test release
of MaraDNS which has the ptr-over-cname fix from the 1.1.xx branch backported
to the 1.0.xx branch.  In addition, the code has been modified to no longer
use strlen().
<p>
Use this code at your own risk.  While I have stress-tested this code for
stability, this code has not been field tested yet.
<p>
That said, it does fix the long-standing bug with correctly resolving
PTR records which are CNAME referrals.  I want to see some people help
me beta-test this, so that I can make a more general release of this
bugfix available.

The daemonizing helper has been renamed 'duende' (Spanish for 'daemon',
consistant with the Spanish theme MaraDNS has, it is said like 'dwen-deh'), 
and now sets up a second child process which syslog()s all of maradns' 
various messages.  Also added new timestamp format with no timestamp
whatsoever to eliminate redundant timestamp when using duende helper.
<p>
(2003.01.27)
</blockquote>

<p>maradns-1.1.13:
<blockquote>
MaraDNS now has a daemonizing helper which makes MaraDNS a daemon, then
stays around.  If either the daemonizing helper or MaraDNS (even
MaraDNS 1.0.xx) gets a HUP signal, MaraDNS is restarted.  If either
process gets a TERM or an INT signal, both processes exit.  If MaraDNS
exits for any other reason besides a HUP signal, the daemonizer
restarts MaraDNS.

<p>maradns-1.1.12:
<blockquote>
MaraDNS now has her own timestamp code which should get rid of any Y2038
problems; on systems with 32-bit time_t, the problems are pushed forward
to 2112 (and can be pushed forward indefinitely by changing only two
magic constants and recompiling).  Note: This means the code only works on
systems with an int64_t; are there any significant Unix systems deployed
which people may wish to use Mara on without int64 support at this point?

MaraDNS with the following seven patches applied:
<ul>
<li>Records with CNAMEs should resolve more nicely on slow links 
    (maradns-1.0.11-incomplete.cname.patch)
<li>Askmara man page updated to say default DNS server address is
    127.0.0.3 (maradns-1.0.11.askmara-man.patch)
<li>Recursive server no longer wastes time with in-bailiwick glueless
    NS referrals (maradns-1.0.11-bailiwick.patch)
<li>References to nslookup in the documentation have been removed, or
    changed to note that nslookup is obsolete

<li>Fixed very slight problem with how the RNG was seeded, should not affect
    most installations of MaraDNS (maradns-1.0.11-rngseed.patch)

<p>maradns-1.1.10:
<blockquote>
MaraDNS is now able to bind to multiple IP addresses.  In addition, I
have set up a signal handler so that MaraDNS can exit with a return code
of 8 when she gets a HUP signal.
<p>
The way MaraDNS binds to multiple IP addresses is by having a socket for
each IP address, and a select() call which determines which socket 
someone connected to.  Since the select() has a timeout, I was able to
set up the HUP signal handler to only change a global variable.
<p>
Proper HUP signal handling will be handled by a daemonizer wrapper, which
I will write next.

over TCP without being able to transfer zone file.
<li>It is now possible to use an old zoneserver mararc with the new
    zoneserver.

<blockquote>
Now that 1.0.00 is released, I am deprecating the 0.5.xx branch. 
The only updates to this branch will be to fix bugs worth disclosing
on Bugtraq.  In other words, security bugs.
<p>
If anyone wants to maintain this branch of MaraDNS, let me know.
<p>
This release back ports some cleanup I did with dns/Queries.c which
also applies to the 0.5.xx branch.

Removed timestamp format which allows us to see the PID; this
was only needed for debugging purposes.

Bug fixes: 
<ul>
<li>
DNS records with a TTL of less than 30 seconds now have a
visible TTL of 30 seconds.  This is to work around stub resolvers (such
as Mozilla's stub resolver) which can not resolve RRs with extremely
short TTLs.
<li>
Lines which are too long in mararc files now return a properly formatted
error message.
</ul>
I have begun work on the new decompressor; however no changes have been
made to the actual compression code yet.  However, there are now
documents that specify how the new decompression will work and header
files which the new decompression code will use.

Trivia: Cinco de Mayo celebrates a battle that Mexico won in 1862
in Puebla, Mexico (I visited the site of the battle several times
when I was down there; it is a beautiful eucalyptus forest, having a 
beautiful fountain and planetarium) against the French.  As it turned out, 
the French won the war, but Mexico won that one battle, which has been 
celebrated since then.  Also, with the exception of Puebla, Cinco de 
Mayo is not a big holiday in Mexico; only in the US.

Added the ability for a remote query to get MaraDNS' internal timestamp;
this is only enabled at obscenely high levels of debug_msg_level, since
it is a security risk (there are attacks which are more effective if we
know the target's clock value).

Converted encoding of all files in the MaraDNS source tree from ISO 8859-1

</blockquote>

<p>maradns-0.9.10:
<blockquote><p>
Fixed bug of case where there is a CNAME record, and something happened
when trying to get an A record for the CNAME record.  Previously, MaraDNS
would think the CNAME record had no A record until the CNAME record was
purged from the cache.  Now, MaraDNS is smart enough to store CNAME
records with an A record of "a 'no such host' reply was found when we 
looked for an A record"; and CNAME records without any corresponding A
record only stay in the cache for 30 seconds.
<p>
If data is already in the cache for a given record, and the data has not
expired, then there is no need to spawn a thread to process the record;
now MaraDNS no longer does this.  This should result in greater stability
and less memory usage, since many operating systems do threads poorly.

askmara now can have a user-defined timeout

UNIX-heads will prefer.
<p>
Verified that MaraDNS 0.9.07 compiles on Darwin (a.k.a. Mac OS X) "out of
the box"; this means that MaraDNS now compiles "out of the box" on
Solaris; Linux; and Darwin.  It also <i>should</i> compile on Cygwin; alas
I do not have a working cygwin setup to verify this on.  Between these four
OSes, we cover all of the major flavors of UNIX: Linux is a little
of everything; Solaris is a "System V" UNIX; Darwin is a BSD UNIX clone;
and Cygwin is a pure POSIX implementation.

I was able to reproduce the problem online (but only intermittently), and 
found some iffy-looking code which may be the root of the problem.

<p>maradns-0.8.31:

This is the second beta test candidate for the recursive MaraDNS, since
I found some bugs after releasing MaraDNS 0.8.30.  See the release notes
for MaraDNS 0.8.30 for more on the beta starus of MaraDNS.
<p>
Looking through the source code of the revamped hash structure, I found
a routine which was not revamped.  This would cause a bug in the case
of having two or more zone files which happen to hash to the same 
value--only one of the zone files would load.  Fixed.  I also deleted
some routines which were based on the old hash structure.
<p>
I have modified MaraDNS so the csv1 hash no longer needs to be 
initialized, since the csv1 hash does nothing but waste memory in 
recursive-only MaraDNS configurations.
<p>
I have added another parameter: timeout_seconds, which is how long to wait
for a remote DNS server to reply.  This is mainly useful for slow
networks which need more than two seconds to get a reply from a DNS
server.  Note that the larger this is, the slower MaraDNS answers queries
when a DNS server doesn't respond to DNS requests.
<p>
In addition, I have begun work on the tutorial, which currently
describes how to use MaraDNS in recursive mode, and gives an overview
of DNS.

<p>maradns-0.8.30:
<blockquote><p>
This is a beta test candidate for the recursive version of MaraDNS.  Which
means that the only changes I will make between now and the first beta
release are essential bug fixes (e.g. bugs not mentioned in the man page),
and a basic DNS tutorial, since I have received two emails of the
form "I don't know how to do this DNS stuff, and could use some help".
<p>
The bad news is that, because of the excess of greedy lawyers in the US, I
have added the legal disclaimer to all of the man pages for MaraDNS, and,
in addition, the legal disclaimer appears when MaraDNS is started.
<p>
The good news is that it is possible to have MaraDNS not show the legal
disclaimer when opening up; MaraDNS tells you how to do this when showing the
disclaimer.
<p>
The better news is that I have done a major revamping of the MaraHash 
structure.  This structure is a structure that can both handle records 
being added, and being removed from the hash.  MaraDNS, as far as I can
tell from my offline tests, is now a great deal more stable as a result.
<p>
In addition, I found another memory leak in the recursive code, which I
have plugged.

I have also performed some more documentation touch-ups.

OK, this is a "band-aid" release of MaraDNS.  As I was debugging the problem
with MaraDNS crashing with the new custodian, I discovered that the hash
code is fundamentally broken.  Hence, I need to a major revamp to the
hash code.  In short, the hash needs to have each hash spot point to
a linked list of elements.
<p>
In the meantime, I performed a band-aid fix to the hash that,
while not fixing the problem, makes the problem slightly less bothersome.
This is an interim release until I can really fix the problem this
weekend.
<p>
Updated the FAQ to reflect the slightly changed procedure for joinging the
MaraDNS mailing list ("subscribe" now has to be in the subject line when
one wants to join the list).
<p>
(2001.11.08)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.28:
<blockquote><p>
I fixed a bug in the fila-handling code where chains of records were not
being correctly put at the top of the list.
<p>
I am still receiving reports that MaraDNS freezes up after running for
a while.  I am unable to reproduce this problem.  I have carefully checked 
the recursive code for potential deadlocks, finding none.
<p>
I suspect that there is a certain query which causes thie problem.
Theirfore, I have added the ability for MaraDNS to log all queries she
receives in human-readable format if verbose_level is three or higher.
<p>
While this results in some really huge logs, this will hopefully allow
me to pin down exactly which query causes MaraDNS to lock up, allowing me
to see where MaraDNS locks up, allowing me to resolve the issue.
<p>
(2001.10.31)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.27:
<blockquote><p>
I have added a lot of code which creates a circular linked list.  This
circular linked list is used by the custodian to erase elements from
the cache which have not been recently accessed.
<p>
The psudo-random number generator has been renamed to 'rng', and modified
to be a hash-only primitive.  MaraDNS no longer has any code which can be 
directly used for cryptographic purposes.  Of course, the compression
function of the hash/prng is invertable, and can be used as a stream cipher,
but such is the case for all secure hash functions and secure PRNGs.
<p>
Added a list of features I will not add to the 1.x release of MaraDNS to
the MaraDNS man page.
<p>
The default max_glueless_level is now 10, because some real-world hosts
need a max_glueless_level this high.
<p>
(2001.10.31)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.26:
<blockquote><p>
I have updated the 0QuickStart file to be current with the present
state of MaraDNS.
<p>
The Linux makefile now supports "make debug", useful for making a build
with verbose debugging output.
<p>
Now that I have some decent *roff documentation, I have done some 
improvments to the formatting of the man pages.  Not only do the man pages
look a little more attractive on the tty terminal, the man pages also
look good when made postscript man pages (troff -man -Tps foo.1 > foo.ps).
<p>
In addition, since the -man macros are not documented anywhere on the 
internet, I have somewhat deciphered the tmac.an macro set, and written
up some documentation describing all of the -man macros.
(2001.10.15)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.25:
<blockquote><p>
I have done an audit and an overhaul of how MaraDNS calls locks in the
recursive code.  Hopefully, this will resolve the issues with MaraDNS
freezing after running for a few days.  
<p>
In addition, the recursive resolver now is better able to handle
instances where a NS record points to a list of IPs.
<p>
More documentation updates.  The man page for maradns now has a guide on
how to set up a firewall to allow maradns packets through, and a list of 
known issues where MaraDNS breaks the DNS spec.
<p>
The crypto-emasculated version of MaraDNS no longer binds the source port
of outgoing UDP queries.  This is because the underlying OS may generate
secure source port numbers when the source port is not specified in the
application.
<p>
(2001.10.12)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.24:
<blockquote><p>
I have created a tool, called <TT>debug.hostname</TT> in the tools directory,
which gives a very verbose trace trying to look up a given hostname.  
This will hopefully help me to debug and fix problematical hostnames.
<p>
I have also created a tool, called <TT>faq2man</TT> which converts
the HTML faq in to a format suitable for embedding in to a man page.
This makes the FAQ section of the MaraDNS man page more attractive
<p>
I have made the maximum glueless level user-configurable, since it looks
like some hosts do not resolve with the old hard-wired default of 4.  I
have also made the maximum number of queries performed total in a 
recursive lookup user-configurable
<p>
I have added more helpful error messages which tell the user what to
fix in their mararc file if MaraDNS can not initialize the DNS cache or
the random number seed.  The init_cache() and init_crypto()
failed error messages should not be visible any more.
<p>
Documentation update:  There is now a man page description of the mararc 
file.  The CREDITS and FAQ files have been updated, in addition to almost 
all man pages.  For example, I have gotten rid of the two or three pages
of ugly troff syntax that Perl's pod2man program generates in the Man pages
which had this.
<p>
<TT>make</TT> run without <TT>./configure</TT> now works again.
<p>
Since MaraDNS used to act in a different manner than Python 1.5.2 with
respect to multiple declations of the same index of the same dictionary
variable, I have changed MaraDNS so that she exits with a fatal error
should this occur, showing the user the line with the problem.
<p>
Made the error message which pops up when a csv1 zone file pointer is
incorrectly formatted more helpful.
<p>
There was a minor security weakness with the PRNG which would pop up if 
the seed was a fixed file, two copies of MaraDNS used the same seed
file, and the two files were started at the same time.  This has been fixed.  
The seed is now exclusive-ored with the process ID before generating numbers.
<p>
More trimming of unused routines in the AES code.  The AES code now only
supports encryption with a 128-bit key and block size in ECB mode--the
only way we use AES in MaraDNS.
<p>
For people who can not legally have any kind of cryptography in their
code (French citizens, etc.), there is now a script in the <TT>tools</TT>
directory, <TT>remove.aes</TT> which removes all crypto code.  Note that, 
while the main MaraDNS suite will still compile after running this, some 
programs in the <TT>tools/misc</TT>, <TT>test</TT> and <TT>sqa</TT> 
directories will no longer compile. <TT>make</TT> still works, of 
course.  Note that removing this code does make MaraDNS more suspectable 
to a spoofing attack. 
<p>(2001.10.08)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.23:
<blockquote><p>
Star records which point to CNAMEs are now completely supported.
<p>
Christophe Colle pointed out that the reason MaraDNS was leaking memory 
when making threads on Solaris was because MaraDNS was not using 
pthread_attr_destroy.  Hopefully, adding this will make MaraDNS
<i>not</i> leak on Solaris.
<p>
Improvment to the "make install" process:  The default configuration
looks for local man pages in <tt>/usr/local/share/man</tt> if 
<tt>/usr/local/man</tt> doesn't exist.  This is to get around some
Linux distributions which don't have <tt>/usr/local/man</tt>
<p>
Minor security tweak to the routine that generates the 16-bit secure
psudo-random number.
<p>
The AES hasher now correctly generates a 128-version of the hash specified
in Bram Cohen's proposed AES hash standard.  Thanks to Bram for providing
test vectors for the 256-version of the hash.
<p>
maradns --version now also includes the build system and date
<p>
(2001.09.27)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.5.30:
<blockquote><p>
Two bugs have been fixed: A bug where a UDP error message normally did
not have the correct query ID, and a bug where, in certain cases, MaraDNS
would return a UDP error instead of a SOA "not there" reply.
<p>
Also, the documentation has been updated. (2001.09.25)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.22:
<blockquote><p>
Document reorganization: I am starting to move the formats of the data files
to separate man pages.  This will make each man page smaller and more
convenient to use.
<p>
Improved CNAME support: MaraDNS now has partial support for star records
that point to a CNAME.
<p>
Less code in the aes directory: I now have a program which generates the
AES tables during the build process, since the code to generate those
tables is a good deal smaller than the tables themselves.  There is no
slowdown, since it is a one-time calculation done during the build process.
<p>
maradns --version (and zoneserver --version) now do the right thing:
Print out the version number and exit
<p>
The installer now removes the zoneserver and the maradns server before
installing the new ones to get around the "text file busy" problem.
<p>
There was a subtle bug with returning "not there" SOA replies and
case insensitivity.  This bug has now been fixed.  This bugfix also
needs to be folded back in to the 0.5.xx branch.
<p>
It is now possible to change the class of the query with the getzone client
if possible.  Next: Document this new feature. (2001.09.24)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.21:
<blockquote><p>
<p>
First, the bad news.
<p>
There is a known issue with MaraDNS having memory leaks when used as a 
recursive nameserver on the Solaris operating system.  This problem
does not exist in Linux.  Since I do not have ready access to a Solaris 
box to develop on, I can not resolve this issue.  Until a Solaris developer
steps up to bat and fixes this for me, I am forced to disable recursive DNS 
serving under Solaris.
<p>
I should have ready access to a Solaris again in December,
when I return to the United States.  I have CDs of Solaris eight up
there, in addition to friends with Solaris boxes.
<p>
Now, the good news.
<p>
I have updated the example mararc files to be consistant with the
documentation.  In particular, I now have two "out of the box" working
mararc files.  One for authoritative name serving, and another for 
recursive nameserving.
<p>
I have also updated the installer script to return an error if the 
directories to put the MaraDNS files in do not exist.  In addition,
MaraDNS will install all of the MaraDNS documentation in the directory
specified by the variable DOCS in install.locations.
<p>
Finally, I have updated the FAQ, the man pages, the mararc.format 
documentation, and am working on making separate man pages which describe 
csv1 zone files and the mararc file. (2001.09.20)
</blockquote><p>
<p>maradns-0.8.20:
<blockquote><p>
When doing some tests with the AES engine in MaraDNS, I found that
I inadvertently created a minor security problem w.r.t. ASCII nulls in 
the AES key.  Basically, an "out of the box" MaraDNS configuration had
a 1 in 16 chance of the aes key not having a full 128 bits of entropy.
<p>
I also corrected a minor fault in the aes128 hasher (it
did not previously fully follow the spec, since it counted bytes, not bits),
a minor fault with the top-level Makefile (which did not clean up
tools/misc with a make clean), and did some minor manpage clean-up.
(2001.09.18)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.19:
<blockquote><p>
Updated the CREDITS file.  If you have contributed to MaraDNS in any way,
no matter how small, and are not in this file, please let me know so I can
credit you.
<p>
Removed references to routines in the aes/ directory which 
MaraDNS and aes128 do not use.  The aes code is now encrypt-only.
<p>
Added a test, based on Brian Gladman's AES reference code, which verified
that the AES routines are working correctly.
<p>
Some cleanup, corrections, and revisions of the man pages.  I figured out
how to turn off hyphenation and justifaction for man pages, and have hence
disabled these in all of the MaraDNS man pages.
<p>
Streamlining of the build process: <TT>./configure; make; make install</TT>
now does "the right thing".  In addition, <TT>make uninstall</TT> also
automagically does the right thing.
<p>
<STRONG>Important:</STRONG> <TT>make install</TT>
now, by default, installs files in <TT>/usr/local/sbin</TT>, 
<TT>/usr/local/bin</TT>, and man pages in <TT>/usr/local/man</TT>.  If one
has previous installs of MaraDNS in other locations, please change the 
<TT>install.sh</TT> script to the desired location of the MaraDNS files.

</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.18:
<blockquote><p>
Added code which keeps track of allocated memory, allowing me to hunt down
and eliminate memory leaks.  Found four memory leaks in the recursive code:
<UL>
<LI> in_bailiwick did not properly destroy the tempory string "get"
<LI> When a
negative answer was given, query_nameserver did not correctly deallocate
some temporary strings 
<LI> recurse_call did not correctly deallocate the temporary string used 
for glueless queries
<LI> The code that set up the root nameservers in the cache had two strings
which were used to help set up the root nameservers.  This strings were not
deallocated after being used.  This was a one-time, and not continuous, leak.
</UL>

</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.17:
<blockquote><p>
Incorperated a modified form of Franky's patch which adds the max_tcp_procs
kvar to the program.  Added some non-DNS releated tools to the "tools" 
directory.  Clean up of the documentation. (2001.08.28)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.16:
<blockquote><p>
More regression testing: Added test where it sends an answer to a server.  
If the server replies, this is considered an error condition.  Cleaned up
the recursive code (got rid of some XXX to dos): Mainly, MaraDNS sends an
error if she can not spawn a thread.  Documentation reorganized. (2001.08.16)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.15:
<blockquote><p>
Made an 'asktest' program which will be used for regression testing.
(2001.08.15)

<p>maradns-0.8.14:
<blockquote><p>
Added support for a counter that counts the children in the Zone server.
(2001.08.13)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.13:
<blockquote><p>
Askmara doesn't display debug messages which can mess up terminals to the
end user any more.<p>
When an element in the cache is overwritten, the new data is now added 
to the cache.<p>
New feature: MaraDNS can now blacklist spammer-friendly DNS servers.
<p>
(2001.08.12)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.12:
<blockquote><p>
Fixed bug in udperror which caused it to spit back the wrong query ID. <P>
Added code to use a counter to count the number of threads.  If we have more
than maxprocs threads going on at the same time, we refuse to launch a thread.
<P>Cached data now will go through round-robin rotates. 
<P>MaraDNS now compiles again when the locale is set to Spanish (though
I still need more Spanish translations.  Maybe when I am in México, I can
get help down there)
(2001.08.11)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.5.29:
<blockquote><p>
Backported some bug fixes with zone file handling back to the "stable"
authoritative-only branch of MaraDNS.  (2001.08.10)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.11:
<blockquote><p>
Improved handling of CNAME records in the cache.  BSD-dependent routines
(which are currently unused in MaraDNS) are not compiled if we are compiling
on a Solaris box.  (2001.08.08)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.10:

After much work (handling lame delegations better and fixing a bug in
<tt>substring_issame_case</tt>), I have managed to get the host name
linuxemu.retrofaction.com to resolve.

Fixed the zoneserver so it too only answers questions.  Fixed two bugs in 
the getzone client: One where it would handle MX records incorrectly, 
another where it would hand the root zone incorrectly (this bug was actually
in the Queries.c file).  (2001.07.27)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.06:
<blockquote><p>
We now check to make sure we only answer questions. (2001.07.18)

<p>maradns-0.8.05:
<blockquote><p>
Added support for multiple root name servers.  Also changed the example 
mararc file to have the root servers for eight different top level
domain registries listed. (2001.07.16)

MaraDNS now sucessfully compiles on Solaris.  Thanks to 
Franky Van Liedekerke for providing the pointers on how to do this,
and to Danny for access to a Solaris machine to compile MaraDNS on.
(2001.07.14)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.03:
<blockquote><p>
Solaris support added, but does not fully work, added disclaimer, improved 
code which drops group privileges.
(2001.07.13)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.02:
<blockquote><p>
Another bug fix: If a zone did not have a record of a given type at the
"top" of the zone, MaraDNS would attempt to perform recursion instead of
returning a SOA record in the authority section.  Fixed.  Also needs to
be fixed in the 0.5.xx branch.  Thanks to D Richard Felker III for 
finding the bug. (2001.07.10)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.01:
<blockquote><p>
Touch up bug fix: MaraDNS failed to close open file descripters when reading
zone files.  Fixed.  Also needs to be fixed in the 0.5.xx series.
Thanks to Boris Manojlovic for finding the bug.
(2001.07.09)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.5.26:
<blockquote><p>
Fixed a couple of long-standing bugs found while debugging the recursive
version of MaraDNS:

<ul>
<li>Fixed a subtle bug in the DNS compression code that would only
    show up in certain rare circumstances.
<li>Fixed a bug in the handling of ANY DNS queries.
</ul>
(2001.07.08)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.8.00:
<blockquote><p>
This is the first alpha release of the recursive nameserver.  I fixed a bug
in the compression code, and fixed another bug which was causing problems with
glueless name server entries. (2001.07.08)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.7.22:
<blockquote><p>
www.monty.de now successfully resolves; fixed bug where the custodian
could potentially erase the root name server entry, making MaraDNS 
non-functional as a root nameserver until restarted. (2001.07.07)

<p>maradns-0.7.21:
<blockquote><p>
Type ANY queries now work for recursive queries.  Finally. (2001.07.06)

<p>maradns-0.7.20:
<blockquote><p>
Another late night double feature MaraDNS show.  There was a really nasty
bug which Jaakko pointed out to me.  I found the culprit, and fixed the bug.
(2001.07.04)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.7.19:
<blockquote><p>
Begun work on some of the infastructure changes needed to make MaraDNS 
sucessfully resolve recursive ANY queries.  Added maradns_gid support.  
Other pieces of code cleanup, primarily better handling of RR_ANY when
acting as an authoritative nameserver (should I fold these changes in to 
a 0.5.26 release eventually?).  (2001.07.04)

<p>maradns-0.7.18:
<blockquote><p>
Re-arranging of the engine that returns an answer from the cache.  We check
the cache expire of a "host not here" reply.  Updated the documentation so 
that it is the 0.5.25 documentation with the recursive stuff added as
needed.  (2001.07.01)

We now choose a random DNS server to query when we are looking for an
answer. (2001.07.01)

<p>maradns-0.7.16:
<blockquote><p>
Updated documentation to include information on how to set up a recursive
nameserver.  Fixed bug where multiple levels of CNAME indirection were not
being properly followed.  It is now possible to go to www.imdb.com or
groups.yahoo.com (both cases of multiple levels of CNAME indirection).  
(2001.06.30)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.7.15:
<blockquote><p>
I have added support for negative caching: If a given host name
does not exist, the program sends a "not here" to the stub resolver.
I also fixed a bug which was causing out-of-bailiwock queries to not work.
(Having to do with the case-sensitivity issue).  Next: Getting www.monty.de
to work, caching ANY replies. (2001.06.28)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.7.14:
<blockquote><p>
MaraDNS now works as a recursive nameserver again.  The root nameserver

resolver can now understand.  (2001.06.25)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.7.13:
<blockquote><p>
After much tinkering with the code, I have managed to make it so that 
a CNAME record in the cache returns the corresponding A record (note: only
one A record!) along with the CNAME record.  This should allow hosts like
www.yahoo.com to work when this is used as a stub resolver. (2001.06.24)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.7.12:
<blockquote><p>
More work done on plugging memory leaks.  Working on code that will 
determine the ip for a given CNAME record, since stub resolvers are not
smart enough to do a second A query themselves when they see a CNAME

suggested. (2001.06.22)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.7.11:
<blockquote><p>
Finished work on the custodian.  Now, I need to make sure the custodian
works.  Also fixed CNAME support so it now works, plugged a couple more
memory leaks, and revised the offline testbed to have a CNAME record.
(2001.06.21)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.7.10:
<blockquote><p>
Bigfixes: I have plugged some memory leaks, and added code which will
(hopefully) allow recursive queries to cname records to work.
I have also done some more work on the "custodian" code.
(2001.06.21)

<p>maradns-0.7.09:
<blockquote><p>
Bugfix release: MaraDNS now closes the sockets that she opens when 
performing recursive queries.  This stops the open sockets from piling
up.  Also, I have begun work on the "custodian" code: Code the reduces
the number of elements in the cache when the user-defined cache runs
low on space. (2001.06.20)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.7.08:
<blockquote><p>
I have made the RNG truly random, and I have added code to the resolution
algorithm which allows it to perform recursive queries when the only 
authoritative records are NS delegation records.  Also, updates to the
todo list.  Changed cc to gcc in all the makefiles to make
MaraDNS more Solaris-friendly.  (2001.06.20)
</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.7.07:
<blockquote><p>
I have added ACLs which limit who is allowed to make recursive queries.
I have also begun work on making the random number seed truly random.

</blockquote><p>

<p>maradns-0.7.06:
<blockquote><p>
I have updated the non-recursive code to use code from MaraDNS 0.5.25,
which adds a number of features from there (round robin rotation, etc.)
I have alos made a list of things which need to be done before I can
make this a beta candidate for a 1.0 release.  In addition, the code now
makes sure that the query ID we receive is the same one we sent out.
I have also started work on a CREDITS file, updated the FAQ, and added
a couple of interesting (if not MaraDNS-specific) Perl scripts to the
archive.

<p>maradns-0.7.05:
<blockquote><p>
The DNS server now has a psudo-random number generator which uses the
Rijndael algorithm.  This PRNG randomizes both the query ID and (I believe)
the source port of any and all DNS queries.   This PNRG now needs to become
secure (by setting up either a random or a user-defined Rijndael key)

<p>maradns-0.7.03:
<blockquote><p>
This release has implemented the ability to expire records from the cache.
All Name server records have a fixed expire of 1 day (this can be changed

expire time based on the TTL of the record.  <b>I have not yet tested
DNS RR expire</b>.

Milestone: This is the first release of MaraDNS that works as a recursive
nameserver with the real root nameservers.  Fix: Changing only the case of 
the first nameserver, add negative caching, then start adding security
(good RNG for the query ID and source port, recursive ACL), then start
making the root servers customizable (including being able to have different
TLDs have different root servers). (2001.06.11)

MaraDNS now can handle gluelessness.  I am bumping up the minor version
number to reflect that MaraDNS now has recursive nameserving capabilities,
albeit without some security features.  Next:  Work on cache flushing and 
security.

Now, if one of the IP nameservers is bad, we will try the next nameserver

<p>maradns-0.6.20:
<blockquote><p>

Two big improvments: 1) The recursive resolver can now handle multiple
A records (MaraDNS deliberately ignores NS and AR records.  Note that it is
a good idea to give out the corresponding A record for a CNAME record
[To do]) 2) There is now code which makes a local copy of the chain
of NS records in an authoritative-only section, which will allow me to
make thread-safe code which will query other nameservers, should a given
nameserver not function (e.g. Someone changed a computer's IP.  In the
three weeks it can take Network Solutions to update the records on the
root nameservers, we still want to be able to reach the domain in question
by using the other listed nameserver for the domain)

Not only did I get to spend some time with my family this memorial day 
weekend, I also was able to get Linux up and going on my new laptop.  Took
two installs, but everything except SSL in Konqueror now works. 
I also, now that the new laptop is (mostly) up and going, have gotten
a chance to work on MaraDNS.  This new laptop, since it has a working battery,
should speed up MaraDNS development--I can now work on MaraDNS on the train.
The latest version is able to go to a remote server and give us an 
incomplete answer (only one RR) based on what the remote server tells us.

Two minor bug fixes: The erre-con-erre-cigarro.maradns.org query will work,

as the GNU Hurd. (2001.05.21)

<p>maradns-0.5.23:

Three bug fixes: MaraDNS now works with RRs for the root namserver (MaraDNS,

a timeout (and can ask questions about the root nameserver), and the output
that MaraDNS generates is unbuffered.  (2001.05.19)

maradns-0.5.01: Bugfix: Since mail exchangers routinely ask for "all records"
                queries (to get both A and MX records), I have hacked MaraDNS
                to deliver A and MX records if a request for all records
                is received.  I still need to code the case of a request for
                "all records" pointing to a CNAME, though.  Also, I have
                added a benchmark tool which times a DNS server by sending
                50,000 queries to the server in question as quickly as
                possible.  (2001.04.13)

maradns-0.5.00: The UDP server no longer fork()s off processes to process

                processing 81 queries a second for over an hour--MaraDNS 
                performed beautifully--memory usage did not increase, and

                performed.  Added support for CNAME and limited NS record
                support.  (2001.03.26)

<p>
maradns-0.2.04: New security feature: Maxprocs, which is a mandatory way
                of limiting the resources MaraDNS uses.  Added fix.perms
                tool. (2001.03.26)

<p>
maradns-0.2.03: I have made the directory structure a little cleaner.  The
                only problem I have now is that multiple Makefiles have to
                be changed if I add a new object file.  I also have improved
                the way MaraDNS cleans up after her children. (2001.03.26)

<p>
maradns-0.2.02: Now, MaraDNS correctly returns NS records and AN records for 
                every query where it has NS and AN records in its local 
                database.  While I wait for the clows at NSI to figure 
                out why we can't make maradns.com and maradns.org use 
                ns.maradns.com and ns.maradns.org as name servers for
                both domains, I can test things with www.z.maradns.org
                (2001.03.25) 

<p>
maradns-0.2.01: Bugfix: SOA lines can now have percent escape sequences in 
                them. (2001.03.25)

<p>
maradns-0.2.00: Incremented minor number in light of the fact MaraDNS now
                actually resolves, albeit in a very limited fashion.  Added
                some QuickStart notes, and added the ability for uint16s and
                uint32s to be added directly to the end of a JS_STRING 
                object.  (2001.03.25)

<p>
maradns-0.1.40: MaraDNS now resolves hosts.  It doesn't handle a lot
                of cases where the resolution is not an exact match
                (NS records for stuff below us, star records, etc.) nor
                does it give us NS or AN records, nor the IP for a Cname
                record (if applicable), but at least MaraDNS is finally
                resolving.  To do: js_string function for adding uint16s
                and uin32s in a single fell swoop, and real name resolution.
                (2001.03.25)

<p>
maradns-0.1.39: At this point, MaraDNS binds to a port and listens to
                incoming data.  Next: Actually process the data that 
                she gets (2001.03.24)

<p>
maradns-0.1.38: Added the code that adds pointers to the corresponding A
                records for MX, NS, and CNAME records.  (2001.03.23)

<p>
maradns-0.1.37: Placed the code that converts star records in a more sensible
                location.  Added a new element in the rr answer which is 
                a pointer to the query string (we need this so we can tell
                the resolver both the question and the answer with the NS
                records, and which IP addresses go with which answers in
                the AR records) (2001.03.21)

<p>
maradns-0.1.36: Now we convert star records (record which start off with
                a * label) to an EDNS-style format MaraDNS uses for its
                internal hash of RRs (2001.03.19)

<p>
maradns-0.1.35: Verified that records are placed in the bug hash correctly.
                Next: We can now start making this a working DNS server.
                Bind to the port, answering UDP queries using a simple 
                forking model. (2001.03.18)

<p>
maradns-0.1.34: Added some more security features: It now chroot's and
                changes the uid if it is run as root.  Also made a function
                that adds a RR to the end of a chain of RRs before the first
                NS RR. (2001.03.17)

<p>
maradns-0.1.33: Plugged up some memory leaks in MaraHash.c.  Added a lot
                of code which starts populating the big hash with data.
                (2001.03.17)

<p>
maradns-0.1.32: More work on the the populate+bighash routine.  Now, when
                a syntax error is encountered, MaraDNS makes a best-faith
                effort to continue processing zone files.  (2001.03.16)

<p>
maradns-0.1.31: Additional work on that routine.  Now, it correctly make
                sure that we add the NS records for the zone before the
                NS records, and also fixed some other bugs in this 
                routine.  Next: Make add_rr_to_bighash really check the
                authority of a record and and data to the big hash 
                (2001.03.15)

<p>
maradns-0.1.30: Worked on the routine to fill up the "big hash" with the
                appropriate data.  Now, I need to replace the "dummy"
                add_rr_to_bighash with a routine that adds the appropriate
                rr to the big hash (if appropriate).  (2001.03.14)

<p>
maradns-0.1.29: Installed a new verison of Linux on my Laptop (Esware 2.0r2,
                a Spanish RedHat clone with the 2.4 kernel).  Begun work
                on MaraDNS.c.  Next: continue work on MaraDNS.c
                (2001.03.13)

<p>
maradns-0.1.28: Made all of the string literals in ParseMaraRc.c labels which
                point to entries in ParseMaraRc_en.h.  Wrote and documented
                Perl script which automates this kind of work.  
                I did the same with ParseCsv1.c (ParseCsv1_en.h).  
                (2001.03.11)

<p>
maradns-0.1.27: Pasted in read/write/setup kvar code from the code that
                parsed the kiwirc file in the kiwi2 anti-spam package.
                Modified mararc code so that it can parse both simple
                strings and dictionaries (Assosciative arrays)
                Next: The code that populates the DNS lookup hash based on
                the data read from the mararc file.  (2001.03.11) 

<p>
maradns-0.1.26: Made the code that parses mararc lines a little more
                senisible.  It's still hackish, but is somewhat pedantic
                about what kind of syntax it accepts, returning errors
                when wrong syntax is given to it.  (2001.03.10)

<p>
maradns-0.1.25: Added support for % in csv1 file.  Revised csv1.format
                document.  Next: figure out a way to store "star records" 
                in the hash table in such a way as to not step on the 
                EDNS standards.  And implement that method. (2001.03.09)

<p>
maradns-0.1.24: Added support for MX and "Unknown" (user-specified query
                type) data types.  Added support for '\xxx'-style escape
                sequences, making it possible to have arbitrary data in
                the csv1 zone file. (2001.03.08)

<p>
maradns-0.1.23: Changed js_atoi to return unsigned integers.  Added support
                for TXT and SOA records.  Tested to make sure error 
                correction looks good.  Next: PTR shorthand, more efficient 
                Makefile. (2001.03.07)

<p>
maradns-0.1.22: Split off some of the routines in other files to new .c
                files: ParseCsv1.c and Utf8.c.  Created js_addbyte routine.
                Added csv1test and example_csv1 files to test the csv1
                parsing routines.  Created js_changebyte routine.  
                ParseCsv1 routine now parses all data types except for the
                SOA datatype.  Next: SOA datatype, shortcut for PTR datatype.
                (2001.03.07)

<p>
maradns-0.1.21: Wrote utf8test to test the ability to convert ISO 8859-1
                strings to UTF-8 strings.  Found minor bug in code, fixed,
                and now ISO 8859-1 strings are correctly copied.  I had to 
                set up X and recompile xterm to support all this.  Cleaned
	        up the comments in the js_notmatch_offset code (they were
                never cleaned up from the Kiwi days).  Clean up of some
                code in Queries.c.  Wrote about half of the line parsing
                code for parsing csv1 lines. csv1 format doc clean
                up. (2001.03.07)

<p>
maradns-0.1.20: I have decided that MaraDNS will use UTF-8 to support 
     		international characters in domain names.  I have added
 		the draft RFC for UTF8 domain names and a description of
       		UTF8 in the docs.  In terms of code, we now have code	
		that converts ISO 8859-1 to UTF-8.  In addition, I have
 		written up a couple of documents describing the csv1
		non-standard Zone file format, and how MaraDNS will
		resolve a domain name. (2001.03.06)

<p>
maradns-0.1.19: Added routines to handle getting all of the keys of a hash
                in series (in the semi-random order they are in the hash
                table).  Corrected errors in parseline code, it now
                works with foo["bar"] = "baz" lines and no longer considers
                foo["bar"] = baz legal.  foo["bar"] = 1 is still legal.
                (2001.03.04)

<p>
maradns-0.1.18: More ParseMaraRC hacking (this this is a real hack. 
                A really bad hack.  At least the elegant js_string lib
                stops it from being a security problem).  It now has
                routines that can fill up an assosciative array based
                on user-specified keys and values.  Next: Routine that
                reads the rc file, and, based on the data there, begins 
                reading zone files.  The zone files will then be read in
                turn, and then populate a hash.  (2001.03.03)

<p>
maradns-0.1.17: More ParseMaraRC.c hacking.  Now, it can parse
                'foo = {}', 'foo["bar"] = "baz"', and 'foo = "bar"'.  
                Next: Write the routine to read an entire maradnsrc (maybe
                we should just call this mararc) and fill up the hash
                table with the names of all of the zones. (2001.03.03)

<p>
maradns-0.1.16: Modified js_anq_chars handle just numerics.  Made it 
                correctly handle just alphabetics.  Renamed 'ctest' to
                'askmara'.  Rewrote askmara.c to have all labels in
                another file (askmara_labels_en.h), to make translation
                easier.  (2001.03.02)

<p>
maradns-0.1.15: Continuing the retooling of code from the KiwiSpam package
                to use assosciative arrays in ParseMaraRC.c.  Yes, this whole
                parser is a hack instead of a proper parser.  Right now, the
                single line parser groks foo["bar"] = baz.  Next: get it
                to grok foo = {} (2001.03.01)

<p>
maradns-0.1.14: Beginning the retooling of code from the KiwiSpam package
                to use assosciative arrays in ParseMaraRC.c.  This will
                be a fairly extensive code rewrite, considering the code I am
                modding is somewhat hacky itself. (2001.03.01)
 
<p>
maradns-0.1.13: Fixed bug where ctest resolver program did not print out SOA
                replies (2001.02.28)

<p>
maradns-0.1.12: Added support for TXT in ctest resolver code.  Made ctest code
                more hardy--it validates all input and returns an error if
                there is a problem at any point.  
                (2001.02.27)

<p>
maradns-0.1.11: Support for MX and SOA, and a number of other formats that
                may have compressed data in them now added to the 
                decompression routine.  ctest now can parse any RR that
                MaraDNS fully supports except TXT (A, NS, SOA, MX, CNAME, 
                HINFO), and is now a rather verbose dig replacment.  Got
                rid of the cruft variables in the decompression routine.
                Next: Have a routine to decode TXT data.
                (2001.02.27)

<p>
maradns-0.1.10: You know how to handle buggy code?  Rewirte the code so 
                that it is simpler and less buggy.  A lot of the overhead
                I had was not needed to keep things secure.  The docs
                on how MaraDNS handles decompression have been revised 
                also.  RFC1035 decompression now works, still need to
                add MX and SOA, and possibly support for other data types
                that get compressed (SRV, the obscure RFC1035 datatypes, 
                etc.) Also, get rid of some of the cruft variables in the
                decompression code. (2001.02.26)

<p>
maradns-0.1.09: Had a good weekend.  Got to see a friend of mine and his wife
                get baptised.  Continued work on decompress_data.  It is 
                still buggy, but I am working out the bugs. (2001.02.26)

<p>
maradns-0.1.08: Added read_rr_h.  Also began work on decompress_data
                (Ugh.  rfc1035 compression is horrible.)  (2001.02.22)

<p>
maradns-0.1.07: Fixed potential overflow in rtest (probably never exploitable)
                Discovered that DNS servers do not support QDCOUNT > 1 in DNS
		queries.  Made notes in "doc" about this.  (2001.02.21)

<p>
maradns-0.1.06: ctest now sends correctly formed DNS queries to a DNS server
                (2001.02.21)

<p>
maradns-0.1.05: Added hname_2rfc1035, which does the reverse of 
                hname_translate.  Beginning work on ctest, which is a
                test DNS client, to see what kind of replies we get
                from DNS servers. (2001.02.21)

<p>
maradns-0.1.04: Debugged routines in Query.c that convert a RFC1035 question
                in to a query.  Added routine that converts a RFC1035 domain
                name (with class) in to a dotted-decimal hostname.
                (2001.02.20)

<p>
maradns-0.1.03: Began work on debugging routines in Query.  Time to go to
                work (2001.02.20)

<p>
maradns-0.1.02: Wrote first (test-only) server that listens on port 53.
                Using this server to determine what kind of data resolvers
                ask for. (2001.02.20)

<p>
maradns-0.1.01: Added some more RFC1035 data to MaraDns.h (2001.02.20)

<p>
maradns-0.1.00: Begin work on handlers to handle various data types that
                RFC1035 has. (2001.02.20)

<p>
maradns-0.0.08: Added js_anq_chars, js_alpha_chars, and js_an_chars to 
                JsStrCP object.  (2001.02.19)

<p>
maradns-0.0.07: Good morning!  Added mtuple_new, mtuple_put, and mtuple_get
                functions.  Fixed bug where mhash_inc would allow a return
                value of 0.  Fixed Makefile so make clean cleans up mtest
                binary.  Added bounds testing to mhash_resize hashtable size.
                Time to eat breakfast. (2001.02.19)

<p>
maradns-0.0.06: Added mara_tuple support and verified that hash collisions
                are properly handled.  Time to go to evening church recital.
                (2001.02.18)

<p>
maradns-0.0.05: Corrected mhash_resize to blank out the hash we resize to.
                Create mtest.c program to test the creation of hash
                elements.  Time to get ready for church.  (2001.02.18)

<p>
maradns-0.0.04: We now properly handle the case of trying to add an
                element already there (return an error), and have
                more error checking to make sure we don't crash
                because of corrupt hash data.  Added an interactive
                test which lets the user interactively add, delete, and
                view hash elements.  Time to go to bed (2001.02.18)

<p>
maradns-0.0.03: Some more work has been done.  mhash_undef_js and
                mhash_resize functions written and compile. (2001.02.18)

<p>
maradns-0.0.02: MaraHash functions--assosciative array methods utilizing
                a hash--have been set up.  This has the functions
                mhash_create, mhash_js, mhash_inc, mhash_put,
                mhash_get, mhash_undef, mhash_put_js, and mhash_get_js.
                Debugging done--these functions can perform basic
                get/put operatins with elements in an assosciative
                array. (2001.02.18)

<p>
maradns-0.0.01: First version of MaraDNS package.  Added iso-8859-1 support
                to JsStr routines.  Added js_qappend and js_qprepend
                functions there.  In addition to js_qfgrep.  All tested
                functions work and are without error. (2001.02.17)

<p>
