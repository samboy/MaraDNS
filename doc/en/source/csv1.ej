<h1>NAME</h1>
csv1 - Format of the csv1 zone file that MaraDNS uses

<h1>SPECIAL NOTE</h1>

The csv1 zone file format is supported primarily for MaraDNS users who 
already have zone files in the csv1 format.  MaraDNS now supports a 
csv2 zone file format.  Note that the csv1 zone file format will continue 
to function as long as I am MaraDNS' maintainer.  

<h1>SPECIAL CHARACTERS</h1>

<dl>
<dt>
| 
<dd>
This delimits fields 
<dt>
# 
<dd>
This signifies a comment.  Lines starting with this are 
ignored, otherwise it has no significance
<dt>
% 
<dd>
This, in domain names, signifies that the rest of the domain 
name should be the name of this zone
<dt>
* 
<dd>
This is translated to mean "any host name that otherwise 
does not resolve".  It must be at the beginning of a 
domain name. 
<dt>
\ 
<dd>
This is used as an escape character, either to escape 
octal values such as '\045' for %, or to escape the '%' 
character so it has no special meaning, or to escape the 
backslash character.
</dl>

<h1>NOTES ON PROCESSING</h1>

All domain-name labels are converted to their lower-case equivalents before
processing is done.  This is because domain-name literals in the database
with one or more upper-case letters in them are case-sensitive.  This is
my way to resolve RFC1035 schizophrenic desire to both allow binary domain
labels, and its desire to be case-insensitive.
<p>

The file must first have a SOA record, followed by one or more NS records,
followed by other records.  The initial NS and SOA records must be RR for
this zone.  NS records after any non-NS record must be part of 
another zone.  The resolution algorithm will not break if non-CNAME records 
share records with a CNAME record, but this is not a good idea to do.
<p>

<h1>RR FORMAT</h1>

A domain name is a one-letter designation of its type, followed by the
domain name separated by dots, ending with either a % or a trailing dot.
If the domain name does not end with a % or trailing dot, an error is 
returned.

<h1>SUPPORTED RR TYPES</h1>

MaraDNS only supports the following types of resource records (RRs) in
csv1 files.  More resource records types are supported in csv2 zone files;
see <b>csv2(5)</b> for details.

<h1>FORMAT OF SUPPORTED RR TYPES</h1>

Here are the formats, shown by letter name:

<pre>
A: Has three fields
field one: the domain name
field two: the ttl for the name in seconds
field three: the ip address, in dotted decimal notation
Example:
Ahost.example.com.|7200|10.1.2.3
</pre>

A records are described with grueling detail in RFC1035.  In short, an
A record is an IP address for a given host name.

<pre>
N: Has three fields
field one: the domain name of the record
field two: the ttl for the name in seconds
field three: the domain name this NS points to.  
Example:
Nexample.com.|86400|ns.example.com.
</pre>

NS (N here) records are described in RFC1035

<pre>
C: Has three fields
field one: the domain name of the record
field two: the ttl for the name in seconds
field three: the domain this CNAME record points to
Example:
Calias.example.org.|3200|realname.example.org.
</pre>

CNAME (which C is short for) records are described in RFC1035

<pre>
S: Has nine fields
field one: the domain name of the record
field two: the TTL of the record
field three: the origin of the domain.  In other words, the name of the
             primary name server for the domain.
field four: the email address for this domain (in the RFC822, not 
            BIND format)
field five: the serial for the domain
field six: the refresh (how often to see updates) for the domain
field seven: the retry (how often to try when down) for the domain
field eight: the expire (how long before the slave gives up) for the 
             domain
field nine: the minimum (and default) TTL for the domain
Example:
Sexample.net.|86400|%|hostmaster@%|19771108|7200|3600|604800|1800
</pre>

SOA (S here) records are described in RFC1035

<pre>
P: has three fields
field one: the IP we wish to point to (in in-addr.arpa form)
field two: the ttl for the name in seconds
field three: the FQDN for the IP in question  
Example:
P3.2.1.10.in-addr.arpa.|86400|ns.example.com.
</pre>

PTR (P here) records, which are used for reverse
DNS lookups, are described in RFC1035.  Note that
one needs control of the appropriate in-addr.arpa
subdomain to make PTR records visible on the
internet at large.

<pre>
@: has four fields
field one: The host that people send email to
field two: the ttl for this record
field three: The preference for this MX host
field four: The name of this MX host
Example:
@example.com.|86400|10|mail.example.com.
</pre>

MX (@ here) records are described in RFC1035

<pre>
T: has three fields
field one: The host someone wants to get additional information about
field two: the ttl for this record
field three: The desired text.  Any data becomes the record up until a 
             new line is reached.  The new line is not part of the TXT 
             record
Example:
Texample.com.|86400|Example.com: Buy example products online
</pre>

TXT (T here) records are described in RFC1035

<pre>
U: has four fields
field one: The host someone wants a data type normally unsupported by 
           MaraDNS for
field two: the ttl for this record
field three: The numeric code for this data type (33 for SRV, etc.)
field four: The raw binary data for this data type
Example:
Uexample.com.|3600|40|\010\001\002Kitchen sink data
</pre>

The above example is a "Kitchen Sink" RR (see 
draft-ietf-dnsind-kitchen-sink-02.txt) with a "meaning" of 8, a "coding"
of 1, a "subcoding" of 2, and a data string of "Kitchen sink data".
Since this particular data type is not formalized in a RFC at this time,
the most appropriate method of storing this data is by using the catch-all 
"unsupported" syntax.
