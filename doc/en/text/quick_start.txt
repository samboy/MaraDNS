   This guide is for experienced UNIX/Linux/BSD users who just want
   to quickly try out MaraDNS

   MaraDNS acts as an authoritative DNS server. Recursion is
   handled by the included "Deadwood" program.

   To try out Deadwood as a recursive nameserver:

     * Compile MaraDNS and Deadwood. Type in './configure; make' in
       the top-level MaraDNS directory. Note: No need to compile if
       you downloaded a binary RPM or Debian package.
     * The the file deadwood-{version number}/src/Deadwood and
       place it in /usr/local/sbin
     * Take the file server/maradns and place it in /usr/local/sbin
     * Take the file tools/duende and place it in /usr/local/sbin
     * Create an empty directory called /etc/maradns
     * Create a dwood3rc file. This file only needs to be three
       lines long on systems with a /dev/urandom file.

       Here is a sample dwood3rc file:

         ipv4_bind_addresses = "127.0.0.1"
         chroot_dir = "/etc/maradns"
         recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1"

       This dwood3rc file says that MaraDNS will have the ip
       "127.0.0.1" (this is the bind_address), run from the
       directory /etc/maradns (the chroot_dir value), and only
       allow the ip "127.0.0.1" to make recursive queries (the
       recursive_acl value).
     * Place the dwood3rc file in the location /etc/dwood3rc on
       your system.
     * Run Deadwood as a non-daemon:

         /usr/local/sbin/Deadwood

       Since Deadwood needs to bind to a privileged port (port 53),
       it needs to start up running as root. Deadwood is designed
       with security in mind, and will drop root privileges before
       being visible to the public internet.
     * Test Deadwood in another window or virtual terminal

         dig @127.0.0.1 www.yahoo.com

     * In order to make the duende daemonizing tool usable, create
       a directory named /etc/maradns/logger/

         mkdir /etc/maradns/logger

     * If this works, make Deadwood run as a daemon:

         /usr/local/sbin/duende /usr/local/sbin/Deadwood

       duende is a tool that daemonizes maradns; the daemonizer is
       a separate program.
     * If this all works, install MaraDNS and Deadwood:

         make install

   It is also possible to set up the program "maradns" as an
   authoritative name server:

     * Here is the MaraRC file:

         ipv4_bind_addresses = "127.0.0.1"
         chroot_dir = "/etc/maradns"
         csv2 = {}
         csv2["example.com."] = "db.example.com"

     * Have a zone file named db.example.com in the chroot_dir
       (/etc/maradns above) that looks like this:

 example.com. 10.1.2.3

       (Yes, experienced DNS admins, you can have SOA, NS, MX, SRV,
       and any other kind of DNS data stored in a csv2 zone file.
       Read the csv2 man page for details)
     * Queries for example.com will resolve to 10.1.2.3
     * Any other name.example.com query will return a "this host
       does not exist" DNS reply.

   Look in doc (in particular, the tutorial), or read the relevant
   man pages for more information on how to set up Deadwood and
   MaraDNS.
