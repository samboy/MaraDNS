                                 NAME

   csv2 - Description of the csv2 zone file that MaraDNS uses

                             DESCRIPTION

   The csv2 zone file format is MaraDNS' standard zone file
   format. This zone file format uses any kind of whitespace
   (space, tab, and carriage return), or the '|' character, to
   delimit fields.

Tilde delimitation

   In newer MaraDNS releases, the tilde ('~') character is used
   to delimit records in csv2 zone files; in order to maintain
   maximum compatibility with older MaraDNS zone files, this
   feature is only enabled if a tilde is placed between the
   first and second record. Otherwise, tildes are not allowed in
   zone files (except in comments).

   Most older MaraDNS csv2 zone files without the tilde
   character are compatible with the updated csv2 parser, unless
   csv2_tilde_handling is set to 3. All older MaraDNS csv2 zone
   files will parse in MaraDNS if csv2_tilde_handling has a
   value of 0. Older MaraDNS releases also supported the
   csv2_tilde_handling variable (as long as it had a value of
   0); this allowed the same configuration and zone files to be
   used in older and newer MaraDNS releases.

Resource record format

   This zone file format has records in the following form:

     name [+ttl] [rtype] rdata ~

   The name is the name of the record we will add, such as
   "www.example.net.". This must be placed at the beginning of a
   line. The rtype is the record type for the record, such as
   "A" (ipv4 IP address), "MX" (mail exchanger), or "AAAA" (ipv6
   IP address). The ttl is how long other DNS servers should
   store this data in their memory (in seconds); this field
   needs a '+' as its initial character. The rdata is the actual
   data for this record; the format for the rdata is
   type-specific.

   Anything in square brackets is an optional field. If the ttl
   is not specified, the ttl is set to the default ttl value
   (see "Default TTL" below). If the rtype is not specified, it
   is set to be an "A" (ipv4 address) record.

   The zone file supports comments; comments are specified by
   having a '#' anywhere between fields or records; when a '#'
   is seen, the csv2 parser ignores any character it sees (with
   the exception of the '{', which is not allowed in comments)
   until a newline. A '#' can usually be placed inside a field,
   and indicates the end of a field when placed there.

   A '{' character can never be placed in a comment. A '~'
   character is always allowed in a comment, and has no special
   meaning when placed in a comment.

   The following record types are supported; a description of
   the record data format accommodates the record type:

A

   An A record stores an ipv4 address. This is the default
   record type should the record type not be specified. The
   record type has one field in it: the IP for the record.
   Examples:
a.example.net.              10.11.12.13 ~
b.example.net.        A     10.11.12.14 ~
c.example.net. +64000 A     10.11.12.15 ~

PTR

   A PTR record stores the name for a given ipv4 or ipv6
   address, and is used for reverse DNS lookups. This record
   type has one field in it: The name for the record in
   question. Examples:
13.12.11.10.in-addr.arpa.        PTR    a.example.net. ~
14.12.11.10.in-addr.arpa.        PTR    b.example.net. ~
15.12.11.10.in-addr.arpa. +64000 PTR    c.example.net. ~

MX

   A MX record stores a mail exchange record, and is used for
   mail delivery. This record type has two fields in it: The
   priority (or "preference" in traditional DNS parlance) of the
   MX record (lower numbers get higher priority), and the name
   of the mail exchanger. Example of mail for example.net being
   mailed to mail.example.net, which has the IP "10.11.12.16":
example.net.      MX   10 mail.example.net. ~
mail.example.net.      10.11.12.16 ~

AAAA

   An AAAA record stores the ipv6 address for a given name. The
   IP is in standard ipv6 "colon delimited" format: eight 16-bit
   hexadecimal numbers are separated by colons. Two colons
   together indicate multiple streams of all-zero hex numbers.
   This record has only one field, the v6 IP. Example:
a.example.net.   AAAA    fd4d:6172:6144:4e53:ffe::f ~

SRV

   An SRV record stores a "service" definition. This record has
   four fields: Priority, weight, port, and target. For more
   information, please refer to RFC 2782. Example:
_http._tcp.% SRV 0 0 80 a.% ~

NAPTR

   A NAPTR record is described in RFC 2915. Example:
www.example.com. NAPTR 100 100 's';'http+I2R';'' _http._tcp.example.co
m. ~

   Note the semicolons. Because of a bug in MaraDNS 1.4.03 and
   earlier releases, NAPTR records will not parse unless a ~ is
   not used to separate records; a patch to fix this bug is
   available here.

NS

   An NS record specifies the name servers for a given zone. If
   the name servers are not delegation name servers (in other
   words, if the name servers are the authoritative name servers
   for the zone), they need to be at the beginning of the zone,
   either as the first records in the zone, or right after the
   SOA record. The NS records are optional; if not present,
   MaraDNS will make an educated guess of that NS records should
   be there, based on the IPs the MaraDNS process is bound to.
   This record has one field: The name of the name server
   machine. Example:
example.net.    NS    ns1.example.net. ~
example.net.    NS    ns2.example.net. ~

SOA

   An SOA record stores the start of authority for a given zone
   file. This record is optional in a CSV2 zone file; should the
   record not be in the zone file, MaraDNS will synthesize an
   appropriate SOA record. This record can only exist once in a
   zone file: As the first record of the zone file. This record
   has seven fields: The name of the zone, the email address of
   the person responsible for the zone, and five numeric fields
   (serial, refresh, retry, expire, and minimum). Note that the
   SOA minimum does not affect other TTLs in MaraDNS. Example:
x.org. SOA x.org. email@x.org. 1 7200 3600 604800 1800 ~

   If there is a '.' (dot) character in the part of the email
   address before the '@', it needs to be escaped thusly:
x.org. SOA x.org. john\.doe@x.org. 1 7200 3600 604800 1800 ~

   Note that the csv2 parser will not allow more than one dot in
   a row; 'john\.\.doe@x.org' will cause a parse error. In
   addition, the dot character must be escaped with a backslash.

   The serial numeric field may be replaced by the string
   '/serial'; this string tells the CSV2 zone parser to
   synthesize a serial number for the zone based on the
   timestamp for the zone file. This allows one to have the
   serial number be automatically updated whenever the zone file
   is edited. Here is how this special field looks in a SOA
   record:
x.org. SOA x.org. email@x.org. /serial 7200 3600 604800 1800 ~

   The '/serial' string is case-sensitive; only '/serial' in all
   lower case will parse.

TXT

   A TXT record stores arbitrary text and/or binary data for a
   given host name. This record has one field: The text data for
   the record.

   A basic text record can be stored by placing ASCII data
   between two single quotes, as follows:
example.com. TXT 'This is an example text field' ~

   Any binary data can be specified; see the csv2_txt(5) manual
   page for full details.

   If tildes are used to separate records, a TXT record can not
   contain a literal '|' (pipe) character, a '#' literal, a '~'
   literal, nor any ASCII control literal; these characters can
   be added to a TXT record via the use of escape sequences;
   read the csv2_txt man page for details.

SPF

   A SPF record is, with the exception of the numeric rtype,
   identical to a TXT record. SPF records are designed to make
   it more difficult to forge email. Here is one example SPF
   record:
example.com. SPF 'v=spf1 +mx a:colo.example.com/28 -all'

   Use '\x7e' to put a tilde ("~" character) in a SPF record:
example.com. SPF 'v=spf1 +mx a:colo.example.com/28 '\x7e'all'

   More information about SPF records can be found in RFC4408,
   or by performing a web search for 'sender policy framework'.

RAW

   The RAW record is a special meta-record that allows any
   otherwise unsupported record type to be stored in a csv2 zone
   file. The syntax is:
RAW [numeric rtype] [data] ~

   The numeric rtype is a decimal number.

   The data field can, among other thing, have backslashed hex
   sequences outside of quotes, concatenated by ASCII data
   inside quotes, such as the following example:
example.com. RAW 40 \x10\x01\x02'Kitchen sink'\x40' data' ~

   The above example is a "Kitchen Sink" RR with a "meaning" of
   16, a "coding" of 1, a "subcoding" of 2, and a data string of
   "Kitchen sink@ data" (since hex code 40 corresponds to a @ in
   ASCII). Note that unquoted hex sequences are concatenated
   with quoted ASCII data, and that spaces are only inside
   quoted data.

   The format for a data field in a RAW record is almost
   identical to the format for a TXT data field. Both formats
   are described in full in the csv2_txt(5) manual page.

FQDN4

   The FQDN4 (short for "Fully Qualified Domain Name for IPv4")
   record is a special form of the "A" record (see above) that
   instructs MaraDNS to automatically create the corresponding
   PTR record. For example, the following is one way of setting
   up the reverse DNS lookup for x.example.net:
x.example.net. A 10.3.28.79 ~
79.28.3.10.in-addr.arpa. PTR x.example.net. ~

   But the above two lines in a zone file can also be
   represented thusly:
x.example.net. FQDN4 10.3.28.79 ~

   Note that the csv2 parser does not bother to check that any
   given IP only has a single FQDN4 record; it is up to the DNS
   administrator to ensure that a given IP has only one FQDN4
   record. In the case of there being multiple FQDN4 records
   with the same IP, MaraDNS will have multiple entries in the
   corresponding PTR record, which is usually not the desired
   behavior.

   FQDN4 records are not permitted in a csv2_default_zonefile.
   If you do not know what a csv2_default_zonefile is, you do
   not have to worry about this limitation.

FQDN6

   The FQDN6 (short for "Fully Qualified Domain Name for IPv6")
   record is the ipv6 form for the FQDN4 record. Like the FQDN4
   record, this record creates both a "forward" and "reverse"
   DNS record for a given host name. For example, onoe may have:
x.example.net. AAAA fd4d:6172:6144:4e53::b:c:d ~
d.0.0.0.c.0.0.0.b.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.3.5.e.4.4.4.1.6.2.7.1.6.d.4.d.f PTR
x.example.net. ~

   But the above two lines in a zone file can also be
   represented thusly:
x.example.net. FQDN6 fd4d:6172:6144:4e53::b:c:d ~

   Like FQDN4 records, it is the DNS administrator's duty to
   make sure only a single IP has a FQDN6 record.

   FQDN6 records are, like FQDN4 records, not permitted in a
   csv2_default_zonefile. If you do not know what a
   csv2_default_zonefile is, you do not have to worry about this
   limitation.

   FQDN6 records were implemented by Jean-Jacques Sarton.

CNAME

   A CNAME record is a pointer to another host name. The CNAME
   record, in MaraDNS, affects any record type not already
   specified for a given host name. While MaraDNS allows CNAME
   and non-CNAME records to share the same host name, this is
   considered bad practice and is not compatible with some other
   DNS servers.

   CNAME records are not permitted in a csv2_default_zonefile.
   If you do not know what a csv2_default_zonefile is, this fact
   is of no relevance.

               Historical and uncommon resource records

   The following resource records are mainly of historical
   interest, or are not commonly used.

HINFO

   An HINFO record is a description of the CPU (processor) and
   OS that a given host is using. The format for this record is
   identical to a TXT record, except that the field must have
   precisely two chunks.

   The first chunk of a HINFO record is the CPU the host is
   running; the second chunk is the OS the host is running.

   Example:
example.com. HINFO 'Intel Pentium III';'CentOS Linux 3.7' ~

   This resource record is not actively used--the IANA has a
   list of CPUs and OSes that this record is supposed to have.
   However, this list has not been updated since 2002.

WKS

   WKS records are historical records which have been superseded
   by SRV records. The format of the record is an IP, followed
   by a protocol number (6 means TCP), followed by a list of
   ports that a given server has available for services.

   For example, to advertise that example.net has the IP
   10.1.2.3, and has a SSH, HTTP (web), and NNTP server:
example.net. WKS 10.1.2.3 6 22,80,119 ~

   MaraDNS only allows up to 10 different port numbers in a WKS
   record, and requires that the listed port numbers are not be
   higher than 1023.

MD and MF

   MD and MF records are RR types that existed before MX
   records, and were made obsolete by MX records. RFC1035 says
   that a DNS server can either reject these records or convert
   these records in to MX records. BIND rejects these records;
   MaraDNS converts them.

   Example:
example.net. MD a.example.net. ~
example.net. MF b.example.net. ~

   Is equivalent to:
example.net. MX 0 a.example.net. ~
example.net. MX 10 b.example.net. ~

MB, MG, MINFO, and MR

   In the late 1980s, an alternative to MX records was proposed.
   This alternative utilized MB, MG, MINFO, and MR records. This
   alternative failed to gather popularity. However, these
   records were codified in RFC1035, and are supported by
   MaraDNS. Here is what the records look like:
example.net. MB mail.example.net. ~
example.net. MG mg@example.net. ~
example.net. MINFO rm@example.net. re@example.net. ~
example.net. MR mr@example.net. ~

   More information about these records can be found in RFC1035.

AFSDB, RP, X25, ISDN, and RT

   AFSDB, RP, X25, ISDN, and RT are resource records which were
   proposed in RFC1183. None of these resource records are
   widely used.

   With the exception of the ISDN record, the format of these
   records is identical to the examples in RFC1183. The format
   of the ISDN record is identical unless the record has a
   subaddress (SA). If an ISDN record has a subaddress, it is
   separated from the ISDN-address by a ';' instead of
   whitespace.

   If used, here is how the records would look in a csv2 zone
   file:
example.net. AFSDB 1 afsdb.example.net. ~
example.net. RP rp@example.net. rp.example.net. ~
example.net. RP rp2@example.net. . ~
example.net. X25 311061700956 ~
example.net. ISDN 150862028003217 ~
example.net. ISDN 150862028003217;004 ~
example.net. RT 10 relay.example.net. ~

NSAP and NSAP-PTR

   NSAP and NSAP-PTR records were proposed in RFC1706. A NSAP
   record is a hexadecimal number preceded by the string "0x"
   and with optional dots between bytes. This hexadecimal number
   is converted in to a binary number by MaraDNS. A NSAP-PTR
   record is identical to a PTR record, but has a different
   RTYPE.

   More information about these records can be obtained from
   RFC1706.

   If used, here is how the records would look in a csv2 zone
   file:
example.net. NSAP 0x47.0005.80.005a00.0000.0001.e133.ffffff000162.00 ~
example.net. NSAP-PTR nsap.example.net. ~

PX

   The PX RR is an obscure RR described in RFC2163. A PX record
   looks like this in a CSV2 zone file:
example.net. PX 15 px1.example.net. px2.example.net. ~

GPOS

   An GPOS record is a description of the location of a given
   server. The format for this record is identical to a TXT
   record, except that the field must have precisely three
   chunks.

   The first chunk of a GPOS record is the longitude; the second
   chunk is the latitude; the third chunk is the altitude (in
   meters).

   Example:
example.net. GPOS '-98.6502';'19.283';'2134' ~

   More information about this record can be found in RFC1712.

   This resource record is not actively used; for the relatively
   few people who encode their position in DNS, the LOC record
   is far more common.

LOC

   The LOC resource record is an uncommonly used resource record
   that describes the position of a given server. LOC records
   are described in RFC1876.

   Note that MaraDNS' LOC parser assumes that the altitude,
   size, horizontal, and vertical precision numbers are always
   expressed in meters. Also note that that sub-meter values for
   size, horizontal, and vertical precision are not allowed.
   Additionally, the altitude can not be greater than
   21374836.47 meters.

   Example:
example.net. LOC 19 31 2.123 N 98 3 4 W 2000m 2m 4m 567m ~

                            SLASH COMMANDS

   In addition to being able to have resource records and
   comments, csv2 zone files can also have special slash
   commands. These slash commands, with the exception of the
   '/serial' slash command (see "SOA" above), can only be placed
   where the name for a record would be placed. Like resource
   records, a tilde is to be placed after the slash command.
   Note also that slash commands are case-sensitive, and the
   command in question must be in all-lower-case.

   These commands are as follows:

Default TTL

   The default TTL is the TTL for a resource record without a
   TTL specified. This can be changed with the '/ttl' slash
   command. This command takes only a single argument: The time,
   in seconds, for the new default TTL. The '/ttl' slash command
   only affects the TTL of records that follow the command. A
   zone file can have multiple '/ttl' slash commands.

   The default TTL is 86400 seconds (one day) until changed by
   the '/ttl' slash command.

   In the following example, a.ttl.example.com will have a TTL
   of 86400 seconds (as long as the zone file with this record
   has not previously used the '/ttl' slash command),
   b.ttl.example.com and d.ttl.example.com will have a TTL of
   3600 seconds, c.ttl.example.com will have a TTL of 9600
   seconds, and e.ttl.example.com will have a TTL of 7200
   seconds:
a.ttl.example.com.       10.0.0.1 ~
/ttl 3600 ~
b.ttl.example.com.       10.0.0.2 ~
c.ttl.example.com. +9600 10.0.0.3 ~
d.ttl.example.com.       10.0.0.4 ~
/ttl 7200 ~
e.ttl.example.com.       10.0.0.5 ~

Origin

   It is possible to change the host name suffix that is used to
   substitute the percent in a csv2 zone file. This suffix is
   called, for historical and compatibility reasons, "origin".
   This is done as the slash command '/origin', taking the new
   origin as the one argument to this function. Note that
   changing the origin does not change the domain suffix used to
   determine whether a given domain name is authoritative.

   Here is one example usage of the '/origin' slash command:
/origin example.com. ~
www.% 10.1.0.1 ~
% MX 10 mail.% ~
mail.% 10.1.0.2 ~
/origin example.org. ~
www.% 10.2.0.1 ~
% MX 10 mail.% ~
mail.% 10.2.0.2 ~

   Which is equivalent to:
www.example.com. 10.1.0.1 ~
example.com. MX 10 mail.example.com. ~
mail.example.com. 10.1.0.2 ~
www.example.org. 10.2.0.1 ~
example.org. MX 10 mail.example.org. ~
mail.example.org. 10.2.0.2 ~

   It is also possible to make the current origin be part of the
   new origin:
/origin example.com. ~
% 10.3.2.1 ~ # example.com now has IP 10.3.2.1
/origin mail.% ~
% 10.3.2.2 ~ # mail.example.com now has IP 10.3.2.2

Opush and Opop

   The '/opush' and '/opop' slash commands use a stack to
   remember and later recall values for the origin (see origin
   above). The '/opush' command is used just like the '/origin'
   command; however, the current origin is placed on a stack
   instead of discarded. The '/opop' command removes ("pops")
   the top element from this stack and makes the element the
   origin.

   For example:
/origin example.com. ~
/opush mail.% ~ # origin is now mail.example.com; example.com is on st
ack
a.% 10.4.0.1 ~ # a.mail.example.com has IP 10.4.0.1
/opush web.example.com. ~ # mail.example.com and example.com are on st
ack
a.% 10.5.0.1 ~ # a.web.example.com has IP 10.5.0.1
b.% 10.5.0.2 ~ # b.web.example.com has IP 10.5.0.2
/opop ~ # origin is now mail.example.com again
b.% 10.4.0.2 ~ # b.mail.example.com has IP 10.4.0.2
/opop ~ # origin is now example.com
% MX 10 a.mail.% ~ # example.com. MX 10 a.mail.example.com.
% MX 20 b.mail.% ~ # example.com. MX 20 b.mail.example.com.

   The opush/opop stack can have up to seven elements on it.

Read

   The '/read' slash commands allows one to have the contents of
   another file in a zone. The '/read' command takes a single
   argument: A filename that one wishes to read. The filename is
   only allowed to have letters, numbers, the '-' character, the
   '_' character, and the '.' character in it.

   The file needs to be in the same directory as the zone file.
   The file will be read with the same privileges as the zone
   file; content in the file should come from a trusted source
   or be controlled by the system administrator.

   Let us suppose that we have the following in a zone file:
mail.foo.example.com. 10.3.2.1 ~
/read foo ~
foo.example.com. MX 10 mail.foo.example.com. ~

   And a file foo with the following contents:
foo.example.com. 10.1.2.3 ~
foo.example.com. TXT 'Foomatic!' ~

   Then foo.example.com will have an A record with the value
   10.1.2.3, a TXT value of 'Foomatic!', and a MX record with
   priority 10 pointing to mail.foo.example.com.
   mail.foo.example.com will have the IP 10.3.2.1.

   Note that no pre-processing nor post-processing of the origin
   is done by the '/read' command; should the file read change
   the origin, this changed value will affect any records after
   the '/read' command. For example, let us suppose
   db.example.com looks like this:
/origin foo.example.com. ~
% TXT 'Foomatic!' ~
/read foo ~
% MX 10 mail.foo.example.com. ~

   And the file foo looks like this:
% 10.1.2.3 ~
/origin mail.% ~
% 10.3.2.1 ~

   Then the following records will be created:
foo.example.com.      TXT   'Foomatic!' ~
foo.example.com.      A     10.1.2.3 ~
mail.foo.example.com. A     10.3.2.1 ~
mail.foo.example.com. MX 10 mail.foo.example.com. ~

   To have something that works like '$INCLUDE filename' in a
   RFC1035 master file, do the following:
/opush % ~
/read filename ~
/opop ~

   Or, for that matter, the equivalent of '$INCLUDE filename
   neworigin':
/opush neworigin. ~
/read filename ~
/opop ~

                          EXAMPLE ZONE FILE

# This is an example csv2 zone file

# First of all, csv2 zone files do not need an SOA record; however, if
# one is provided, we will make it the SOA record for our zone
# The SOA record needs to be the first record in the zone if provided
# This is a commented out record and disabled.

#%      SOA     % email@% 1 7200 3600 604800 1800 ~

# Second of all, csv2 zone files do not need authoritative NS records.
# If they aren't there, MaraDNS will synthesize them, based on the IP
# addresses MaraDNS is bound to.  (She's pretty smart about this; if
# Mara is bound to both public and private IPs, only the public IPs wi
ll
# be synthesized as NS records)


#%      NS      a.% ~

# Here are some A (ipv4 address) records; since this is the most
# common field, the zone file format allows a compact representation
# of it.
a.example.net.  10.10.10.10 ~
# Here, you can see that a single name, "b.example.net." has multiple
IPs
# This can be used as a primitive form of load balancing; MaraDNS will
# rotate the IPs so that first IP seen by a DNS client changes every t
ime
# a query for "b.example.net." is made
b.example.net.  10.10.10.11 ~
b.example.net.  10.10.10.12 ~

# We can have the label in either case; it makes no difference
Z.EXAMPLE.NET.  10.2.3.4 ~
Y.EXAMPLE.net.  10.3.4.5 ~

# We can use the percent shortcut.  When the percent shortcut is prese
nt,
# it indicates that the name in question should terminate with the nam
e
# of the zone we are processing.
percent.%       a               10.9.8.7 ~

# And we can have star records
#*.example.net.  A              10.11.12.13 ~

# We can have a ttl in a record; however the ttl needs a '+' before it
:
# Note that the ttl has to be in seconds, and is before the RTYPE
d.example.net. +86400 A 10.11.12.13 ~

f.example.net. # As you can see, records can span multiple lines
                A       10.2.19.83 ~

# This allows well-commented records, like this:
c.example.net.          # Our C class machine
        +86400          # This record is stored for one day
        A               # A record
        10.1.1.1        # Where we are
        ~               # End of record

# We can even have something similar to csv1 if we want...
e.example.net.|+86400|a|10.2.3.4|~
h.example.net.|a|10.9.8.7|~
# Here, we see we can specify the ttl but not the rtype if desired
g.example.net.|+86400|10.11.9.8|~

# Here is a MX record
% mx 10 mail.% ~
mail.% +86400 IN A 10.22.23.24 ~

# We even have a bit of ipv6 support
a.example.net.          aaaa    fd4d:6172:6144:4e53:1:2:3::4:f ~

# Not to mention support for SRV records

# TXT records, naturally

# Starting with MaraDNS 1.2.08, there is also support for SPF records,
# which are identical to TXT records.  See RFC4408 for more details.
