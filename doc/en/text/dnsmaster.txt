   I should point out here that "master" and "slave" is somewhat 
   outdated wording.  The more modern wording, "primary" and 
   "replica", is more accurate.  However, since this document was 
   written back when "master" and "slave" was standard terminology, 
   since other mainstream DNS servers still use the "master" and 
   "slave" terminology, and since the relevant DNS RFCs MaraDNS is 
   based on use the words "master" and "slave", this document
   uses that wording.

                Having MaraDNS be a master DNS server

   A master (sometimes called primary) DNS server is a DNS server
   that other DNS servers can automatically transfer zone files
   from. There are limitations to this way of transferring zone
   files; zone files transferred this way lose all comments and the
   ordering of records in the zone file is usually changed.

   In other words, DNS has a mechanism for automatically having
   multiple different servers have the same zone file data. This is
   akin to the rsync program; this allows one to change a zone file
   on the master machine, then have the slave machines
   automatically transfer the zone file from the master machine.

   This is useful when one wants to have multiple machines serving
   DNS data. This is also useful when one wants to register a
   domain, but only has a single IP on the internet. There are a
   number of free DNS secondary (slave) services out there that one
   can use to have a second IP for a DNS server of a domain.

   To set this up, one needs to run the zoneserver daemon in
   addition to the maradns daemon. Both daemons use the same mararc
   configuration file; there are a few mararc variables that affect
   the zoneserver daemon but not the maradns daemon (and vice
   versa).

   When setting up a master DNS server, only one additional mararc
   variable needs to be set up, zone_transfer_acl. This variable
   needs to list the IPs of the slave DNS servers that will
   transfer zones from the master server. For example, if the slave
   DNS servers have the IPs 192.168.72.34, 10.34.56.98, and
   172.17.23.37, the line will look like this:

     zone_transfer_acl = "192.168.72.34, 10.34.56.98, 172.17.23.37"

   If you do not know the IPs of the slave DNS servers, you can
   allow any computer on the internet to connect to your zone
   server thusly:

     zone_transfer_acl = "0.0.0.0/0"

   Note that this will make potentially private information public.

   Something like this can also be done:

     zone_transfer_acl = "192.168.42.0/24, 10.0.0.0/8,
     172.19.0.0/16"

   This will allow any IP starting with "192.168.42" to connect to
   the zone server, any IP starting with "10" to connect to the
   zone server, and any IP starting with "172.19" to connect to the
   zone server.

   Here is a example mararc file which is on the ip 10.1.2.3, and
   serves the zone example.com to the IPs 192.168.72.34,
   10.34.56.98, and 172.17.23.37:

 ipv4_bind_addresses = "10.1.2.3"
 chroot_dir = "/etc/maradns"
 csv2 = {}
 csv2["example.com."] = "db.example.com"
 zone_transfer_acl = "192.168.72.34, 10.34.56.98, 172.17.23.37"

How SOA records affect slave zone servers

   The SOA record tells the slave zone servers how often to check
   to see if a zone file needs to be reloaded. Here is what a SOA
   record looks like:

     example.com. SOA example.com. hostmaster@example.com. 1 7200
     3600 604800 1800

   The first field is the name of the zone this SOA record is for.

   The second field tells the csv2 parser that this is a SOA
   record.

   The third field is the name of the machine which is the DNS
   master server for this zone.

   The fourth field is the email address for the person in charge
   of this zone.

   The fifth field (first numeric field) is what is called the
   "serial" number. This number is used by slave DNS servers to see
   if the zone file has changed. This number should be increased
   every time a zone file is changed. MaraDNS, when generating a
   synthetic SOA record, looks to see when the zone file was last
   changed, and uses a time stamp which updates every six seconds
   as the SOA serial number.

   The sixth field (second numeric field) is the "refresh" for the
   domain; this is how often (in seconds) a slave DNS server could
   check to see if the serial on the master DNS server has changed.

   The seventh field (third numeric field) is the "retry" for the
   domain; when the master DNS server is down, this is how often
   the slave DNS server will check to see if the master DNS server
   is up again. This value, like all time values, is in seconds.

   The eight field (fourth numeric field) is the "expire" for the
   domain; this is how long the slave server will wait before no
   longer attempting to get a zone from a master DNS server when
   the master DNS server is down. This should be a large value.

   The ninth field (fifth numeric field) is the "minimum" for the
   domain; this does not affect how MaraDNS processes a zone file
   and is not used by slave DNS servers (it determines the
   default/minimum TTL with other DNS servers).

   ----------------------------------------------------------------

   The zoneserver program can also be used to serve other DNS
   records over TCP; see the file dnstcp for details.
