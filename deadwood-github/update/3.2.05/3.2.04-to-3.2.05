# Patch: Add -DRG64 option to use RadioGatún[64] (instead of
# RadioGatún[32])
# DISABLED: This code is not needed.  Even though RG64 *is* faster,
# even on 32-bit systems, it uses more code on 32-bit systems (breaking
# Deadwood's ability to fit in 65,536 bytes on Windows).
# Also: This code does not have a test for it.  RG32 is good enough; if
# I'm going to update Deadwood's crypto, do it right: add SipHash, add Keccak, 
# add maybe another stream cipher.
