These tests need MaraDNS to be run.  To run these tests, download both
MaraDNS and Deadwood, and expand the Deadwood tarball in MaraDNS' 
top-level directory.

Use MaraDNS 1.3.14 to run these tests; this will not work with earlier
versions of MaraDNS because the handling of the RA bit was revised in
that MaraDNS release.

Once that is done, as root run the shell script "do.tests" to run all of
the tests; this script will compile MaraDNS and Deadwood with various 
options as needed for the tests.

These tests are designed to be run on a CentOS 5 system (Gnome workstation)
with the basic gcc development environment (kernel-headers, glibc-headers,
glibc-devel, libgomp, gcc) installed.  In addition, not only do the
"gcc43" and "valgrind" packages need to be installed, but also "askmara"
from MaraDNS needs to be in one's path.

The do.tests script needs to be run from this directory.
