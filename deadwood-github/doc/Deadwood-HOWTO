Here are some typical ways to use Deadwood and the corresponding dwood3rc
files:

* To have Deadwood listen on 127.0.0.1 (the localhost IP used by a computer
  so it can talk to itself) and perform local DNS queries:

bind_address = "127.0.0.1"
recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1/16"
chroot_dir = "/etc/maradns"

* To have Deadwood listen on 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.1.42 and perform DNS queries
  for a small LAN:

bind_address = "127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.42"
recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1/16, 192.168.1.1/24"
chroot_dir = "/etc/maradns"

* To have Deadwood perform DNS queries for a small LAN and have the DNS server
  on 192.168.1.111 resolve queries ending in "local":

bind_address = "127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.42"
recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1/16, 192.168.1.1/24"
chroot_dir = "/etc/maradns"
root_servers = {}
root_servers["."]="198.41.0.4, 192.228.79.201, 192.33.4.12, 199.7.91.13,"
root_servers["."]+="192.203.230.10, 192.5.5.241, 192.112.36.4, 128.63.2.53, "
