                                 NAME

   Deadwood - A fully recursive caching DNS resolver

                             DESCRIPTION

   Deadwood is a fully recursive DNS cache. This is a DNS server
   with the following features:

     * Full support for both DNS recursion and DNS forwarding
       caching
     * Small size and memory footprint suitable for embedded
       systems
     * Simple and clean codebase
     * Secure design
     * Spoof protection: Strong cryptography used to determine the
       Query ID and source port
     * Ability to read and write the cache to a file
     * Dynamic cache that deletes entries not recently used
     * Ability to use expired entries in the cache when it is
       impossible to contact upstream DNS servers.
     * IPv6 support can be compiled in if desired
     * Both DNS-over-UDP and DNS-over-TCP are handled by the same
       daemon
     * Built-in dnswall functionality

                        COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

   Deadwood has a single optional command line argument: The
   location of the configuration file that Deadwood uses, specified
   with the "-f" flag. If this is not defined, Deadwood uses the
   file "/etc/dwood3rc" as the configuration file.

   In other words, invoking Deadwood as Deadwood will cause
   Deadwood to use /etc/dwood3rc as the configuration file;
   invoking Deadwood as Deadwood -f foobar will cause Deadwood to
   use the file "foobar" in the current working directory (the
   directory one is in when starting Deadwood) as the configuration
   file.

                      CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT

   The Deadwood configuration file is modeled after Python 2's
   syntax. Any valid Deadwood configuration file should also
   correctly parse in both Python 2.4.3 and Python 2.6.6. If any
   configuration file does correctly parse in Deadwood but raises a
   syntax error in Python, this is a bug that should be fixed.

   This in mind, whitespace is significant; Deadwood parameters
   must be in the leftmost column with no leading whitespace. This
   is a valid line (as long as there are no spaces to its left):

 recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1/16"

   The following line, however, will raise a parse error:

  recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1/16"

   Observe the space to the left of the "recusive_acl" string in
   the incorrectly formatted line.

                           PARAMETER TYPES

   Deadwood has three different parameter types:

     * Numeric parameters. Numeric parameters must not be
       surrounded by quotes, such as this example:

 filter_rfc1918 = 0

       If a numeric parameter is surrounded by quotes, the error
       message "Unknown dwood3rc string parameter" will appear.
     * String parameters. String parameters must be surrounded by
       quotes, such as in this example:

 bind_address = "127.0.0.1"

     * Dictionary parameters. All dictionary parameters must be
       initialized before use, and dictionary parameters must have
       both the dictionary index and the value for said index
       surrounded by quotes, such as in this example:

 upstream_servers = {}
 upstream_servers["."]="8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4"

   All dwood3rc parameters except the following are numeric
   parameters:

     * bind_address (string)
     * cache_file (string)
     * chroot_dir (string)
     * ip_blacklist (string)
     * ipv4_bind_addresses (string)
     * random_seed_file (string)
     * recursive_acl (string)
     * root_servers (dictionary)
     * upstream_servers (dictionary)

                         SUPPORTED PARAMETERS

   The Deadwood configuration file supports the following
   parameters:

bind_address

   This is the IP (or possibly IPv6) address we bind to.

cache_file

   This is the filename of the file used for reading and writing
   the cache to disk; this string can have lowercase letters, the
   '-' symbol, the '_' symbol, and the '/' symbol (for putting the
   cache in a subdirectory). All other symbols become a '_' symbol.

   This file is read and written as the user Deadwood runs as.

chroot_dir

   This is the directory the program will run from.

deliver_all

   This affects behavior in Deadwood 2.3, but has no effect in
   Deadwood 3. This variable is only here so Deadwood 2 rc files
   can run in Deadwood 3.

dns_port

   This is the port Deadwood binds to and listens on for incoming
   connections. The default value for this is the standard DNS
   port: port 53

filter_rfc1918

   When this has a value of 1, a number of different IP ranges are
   not allowed to be in DNS A replies:

     * 192.168.x.x
     * 172.[16-31].x.x
     * 10.x.x.x
     * 127.x.x.x
     * 169.254.x.x
     * 224.x.x.x
     * 0.0.x.x

   If one of the above IPs is detected in a DNS reply, and
   filter_rfc1918 has a value of 1, Deadwood will return a
   synthetic "this host does not reply" response (a SOA record in
   the NS section) instead of the A record.

   The reason for this is to provide a "dnswall" that protects
   users for some kinds of attacks, as described at
   http://crypto.stanford.edu/dns/

   Please note that Deadwood only provides IPv4 "dnswall"
   functionality and does not help protect against IPv6 answers. If
   protection against certain IPv6 AAAA records is needed, either
   disable all AAAA answers by setting reject_aaaa to have a value
   of 1, or use an external program to filter undesired IPv4
   answers (such as the dnswall program).

   The default value for this is 1

handle_noreply

   When this is set to 0, Deadwood sends no reply back to the
   client (when the client is a TCP client, Deadwood closes the TCP
   connection) when a UDP query is sent upstream and the upstream
   DNS never sends a reply.

   When this is set to 1, Deadwood sends a SERVER FAIL back to the
   client when a UDP query is sent upstream and the upstream DNS
   never sends a reply.

   The default value for this is 1

handle_overload

   When this has a value of 0, Deadwood sends no reply when a UDP
   query is sent and the server is overloaded (has too many pending
   connections); when it has a value of 1, Deadwood sends a SERVER
   FAIL packet back to the sender of the UDP query. The default
   value for this is 1.

hash_magic_number

   This used to be used for Deadwood's internal hash generator to
   keep the hash generator somewhat random and immune to certain
   types of attacks. In Deadwood 3.0, entropy for the hash function
   is created by looking at the contents of /dev/urandom
   (secret.txt on Windows machines) and the current timestamp. This
   parameter is only here so older configuration files do not break
   in Deadwood 3.0.

ip_blacklist

   This is a list of IPs that we do not allow to be in the answer
   to a DNS request. The reason for this is to counteract the
   practice some ISPs have of converting a "this site does not
   exist" DNS answer in to a page controlled by the ISP; this
   results in possible security issues.

   This parameter only accepts individual IPs, and does not use
   netmasks.

maradns_uid

   The user-id Deadwood runs as. This can be any number between 10
   and 65535; the default value is 99 (nobody on RedHat-derived
   Linux distributions). This value is not used on Windows systems.

maradns_gid

   The group-id Deadwood runs as. This can be any number between 10
   and 65535; the default value is 99. This value is not used on
   Windows systems.

max_ar_chain

   Whether resource record rotation is enabled. If this has a value
   of 1, resource record rotation is enabled, otherwise resource
   record rotation is disabled.

   Resource record rotation is usually desirable, since it allows
   DNS to act like a crude load balancer. However, on heavily
   loaded systems it may be desirable to disable it to reduce CPU
   usage.

   The reason for the unusual name for this variable is to retain
   compatibility with MaraDNS mararc files.

   The default value is 1: Resource record rotation enabled.

max_inflights

   The maximum number of simultaneous clients we process at the
   same time for the same query.

   If, while processing a query for, say, "example.com.", another
   DNS client sends to Deadwood another query for example.com,
   instead of creating a new query to process example.com, Deadwood
   will attach the new client to the same query that is already "in
   flight", and send a reply to both clients once we have an answer
   for example.com.

   This is the number of simultaneous clients a given query can
   have. If this limit is exceeded, subsequents clients with the
   same query are refused until an answer is found. If this has a
   value of 1, we do not merge multiple requests for the same
   query, but give each request its own connection.

   The default value is 8.

max_ttl

   The maximum amount of time we will keep an entry in the cache,
   in seconds.

   This is the longest we will keep an entry cached. The default
   value for this parameter is 86400 (one day); the minimum value
   is 300 (5 minutes) and the maximum value this can have is
   7776000 (90 days).

   The reason why this parameter is here is to protect Deadwood
   from attacks which exploit there being stale data in the cache,
   such as the "Ghost Domain Names" attack.

maximum_cache_elements

   The maximum number of elements our cache is allowed to have.
   This is a number between 32 and 16,777,216; the default value
   for this is 1024. Note that, if writing the cache to disk or
   reading the cache from disk, higher values of this will slow
   down cache reading/writing.

   The amount of memory each cache entry uses is variable depending
   on the operating system used and the size of memory allocation
   pages assigned. In Windows XP, for example, each entry uses
   approximately four kilobytes of memory and Deadwood has an
   overhead of approximately 512 kilobytes. So, if there are 512
   cache elements, Deadwood uses approximately 2.5 megabytes of
   memory, and if there are 1024 cache elements, Deadwood uses
   approximately 4.5 megabytes of memory. Again, these numbers are
   for Windows XP and other operating systems will have different
   memory allocation numbers.

   Please note that each root_servers and upstream_servers entry
   takes up space in Deadwood's cache and that
   maximum_cache_elements will need to be increased to store a
   large number of these entries.

maxprocs

   This is the maximum number of pending remote UDP connections
   Deadwood can have. The default value for this is 32.

max_tcp_procs

   This is the number of allowed open TCP connections. Default
   value: 8

num_retries

   The number of times we retry to send a query upstream before
   giving up. If this is 0, we only try once; if this is 1, we try
   twice, and so on, up to 32 retries. Note that each retry takes
   timeout_seconds seconds before we retry again. Default value: 5

ns_glueless_type

   The RR type we send to resolve glueless records. This should be
   1 (A) when mainly using IPv4 to resolve records. If glueless NS
   records have AAAA but not A records, and IPv6 is enabled, it may
   make sense to give this a value of 255 (ANY). If IPv4 ever stops
   being used on a large scale, it may eventually become possible
   to make this have a value of 28 (AAAA).

   The default value is 1: An A (IPv4 IP) record. This parameter
   has not been tested; use at your own risk.

random_seed_file

   This is a file that contains random numbers, and is used as a
   seed for the cryptographically strong random number generator.
   Deadwood will try to read 256 bytes from this file (the RNG
   Deadwood uses can accept a stream of any arbitrary length).

   Note that the hash compression function obtains some of its
   entropy before parsing the mararc file, and is hard-coded to get
   entropy from /dev/urandom (secret.txt on Windows systems). Most
   other entropy used by Deadwood comes from the file pointed to by
   random_seed_file.

recurse_min_bind_port

   The lowest numbered port Deadwood is allowed to bind to; this is
   a random port number used for the source port of outgoing
   queries, and is not 53 (see dns_port above). This is a number
   between 1025 and 32767, and has a default value of 15000. This
   is used to make DNS spoofing attacks more difficult.

recurse_number_ports

   The number of ports Deadwood binds to for the source port for
   outgoing connections; this is a power of 2 between 256 and
   32768. This is used to make DNS spoofing attacks more difficult.
   The default value is 4096.

recursive_acl

   This is a list of who is allowed to use Deadwood to perform DNS
   recursion, in "ip/mask" format. Mask must be a number between 0
   and 32 (for IPv6, between 0 and 128). For example, "127.0.0.1/8"
   allows local connections.

reject_aaaa

   If this has a value of 1, a bogus SOA "not there" reply is sent
   whenever an AAAA query is sent to Deadwood. In other words,
   every time a program asks Deadwood for an IPv6 IP address,
   instead of trying to process the request, when this is set to 1,
   Deadwood pretends the host name in question does not have an
   IPv6 address.

   This is useful for people who aren't using IPv6 but use
   applications (usually *NIX command like applications like
   "telnet") which slow things down trying to find an IPv6 address.

   This has a default value of 0. In other words, AAAA queries are
   processed normally unless this is set.

reject_mx

   When this has the default value of 1, MX queries are silently
   dropped with their IP logged. A MX query is a query that is only
   done by a machine if it wishes to be its own mail server sending
   mail to machines on the internet. This is a query an average
   desktop machine (including one that uses Outlook or another mail
   user agent to read and send email) will never make.

   Most likely, if a machine is trying to make a MX query, the
   machine is being controlled by a remote source to send out
   undesired "spam" email. This in mind, Deadwood will not allow MX
   queries to be made unless reject_mx is explicitly set with a
   value of 0.

   Before disabling this, please keep in mind that Deadwood is
   optimized to be used for web surfing, not as a DNS server for a
   mail hub. In particular, the IPs for MX records are removed from
   Deadwood's replies and Deadwood needs to perform additional DNS
   queries to get the IPs corresponding to MX records, and
   Deadwood's testing is more geared for web surfing (almost 100% A
   record lookup) and not for mail delivery (extensive MX record
   lookup).

reject_ptr

   If this has a value of 1, a bogus SOA "not there" reply is sent
   whenever a PTR query is sent to Deadwood. In other words, every
   time a program asks Deadwood for "reverse DNS lookup" -- the
   hostname for a given IP address -- instead of trying to process
   the request, when this is set to 1, Deadwood pretends the IP
   address in question does not have a hostname.

   This is useful for people who are getting slow DNS timeouts when
   trying to perform a reverse DNS lookups on IPs.

   This has a default value of 0. In other words, PTR queries are
   processed normally unless this is set.

resurrections

   If this is set to 1, Deadwood will try to send an expired record
   to the user before giving up. If it is 0, we don't. Default
   value: 1

root_servers

   This is a list of root servers; its syntax is identical to
   upstream_servers (see below). This is the type of DNS service
   ICANN, for example, runs. These are servers used that do not
   give us complete answers to DNS questions, but merely tell us
   which DNS servers to connect to to get an answer closer to our
   desired answer.

   Please note that each root_servers entry takes up space in
   Deadwood's cache and that maximum_cache_elements will need to be
   increased to store a large number of these entries.

tcp_listen

   In order to enable DNS-over-TCP, this variable must be set and
   have a value of 1. Default value: 0

timeout_seconds

   This is how long Deadwood will wait before giving up and
   discarding a pending UDP DNS reply. The default value for this
   is 1, as in 1 second, unless Deadwood was compiled with
   FALLBACK_TIME enabled.

timeout_seconds_tcp

   How long to wait on an idle TCP connection before dropping it.
   The default value for this is 4, as in 4 seconds.

ttl_age

   Whether TTL aging is enabled; whether entries in the cache have
   their TTLs set to be the amount of time the entries have left in
   the cache.

   If this has a value of 1, TTL entries are aged. Otherwise, they
   are not. The default value for this is 1.

upstream_port

   This is the port Deadwood uses to connect or send packets to the
   upstream servers. The default value for this is 53; the standard
   DNS port.

upstream_servers

   This is a list of DNS servers that the load balancer will try to
   contact. This is a dictionary variable (array indexed by a
   string instead of by a number) instead of a simple variable.
   Since upstream_servers is a dictionary variable, it needs to be
   initialized before being used.

   Deadwood will look at the name of the host that it is trying to
   find the upstream server for, and will match against the longest
   suffix it can find.

   For example, if someone sends a query for "www.foo.example.com"
   to Deadwood, Deadwood will first see if there is an
   upstream_servers variable for "www.foo.example.com.", then look
   for "foo.example.com.", then look for "example.com.", then
   "com.", and finally ".".

   Here is an example of upstream_servers:

 upstream_servers = {} # Initialize dictionary variable
 upstream_servers["foo.example.com."] = "192.168.42.1"
 upstream_servers["example.com."] = "192.168.99.254"
 upstream_servers["."] = "10.1.2.3, 10.1.2.4"

   In this example, anything ending in "foo.example.com" is
   resolved by the DNS server at 192.168.42.1; anything else ending
   in "example.com" is resolved by 192.168.99.254; and anything not
   ending in "example.com" is resolved by either 10.1.2.3 or
   10.1.2.4.

   Important: the domain name upstream_servers points to must end
   in a "." character. This is OK:

 upstream_servers["example.com."] = "192.168.42.1"

   But this is not OK:

 upstream_servers["example.com"] = "192.168.42.1"

   The reason for this is because BIND engages in unexpected
   behavior when a host name doesn't end in a dot, and by forcing a
   dot at the end of a hostname, Deadwood doesn't have to guess
   whether the user wants BIND's behavior or the "normal" behavior.

   If neither root_servers nor upstream_servers are set, Deadwood
   sets root_servers to use the default ICANN root servers, as
   follows:

 198.41.0.4      a.root-servers.net (VeriSign)
 192.228.79.201  b.root-servers.net (ISI)
 192.33.4.12     c.root-servers.net (Cogent)
 199.7.91.13     d.root-servers.net (UMaryland)
 192.203.230.10  e.root-servers.net (NASA Ames)
 192.5.5.241     f.root-servers.net (ISC)
 192.112.36.4    g.root-servers.net (DOD NIC)
 128.63.2.53     h.root-servers.net (ArmyRU)
 192.36.148.17   i.root-servers.net (NORDUnet)
 192.58.128.30   j.root-servers.net (VeriSign)
 193.0.14.129    k.root-servers.net (Reseaux)
 199.7.83.42     l.root-servers.net (IANA)
 202.12.27.33    m.root-servers.net (WIDE)

   This list is current as of May 3, 2010, and was last changed on
   November 1, 2007.

   Please note that each upstream_servers entry takes up space in
   Deadwood's cache and that maximum_cache_elements will need to be
   increased to store a large number of these entries.

verbose_level

   This determines how many messages are logged on standard output;
   larger values log more messages. The default value for this is
   3.

                        ip/mask format of IPs

   Deadwood uses a standard ip/netmask formats to specify IPs. An
   ip is in dotted-decimal format, e.g. "10.1.2.3" (or in IPv6
   format when IPv6 support is compiled in).

   The netmask is used to specify a range of IPs. The netmask is a
   single number between 1 and 32 (128 when IPv6 support is
   compiled in), which indicates the number of leading "1" bits in
   the netmask.

   10.1.1.1/24 indicates that any ip from 10.1.1.0 to 10.1.1.255
   will match.

   10.2.3.4/16 indicates that any ip from 10.2.0.0 to 10.2.255.255
   will match.

   127.0.0.0/8 indicates that any ip with "127" as the first octet
   (number) will match.

   The netmask is optional, and, if not present, indicates that
   only a single IP will match.

                             DNS over TCP

   DNS-over-TCP needs to be explicitly enabled by setting
   tcp_listen to 1.

   Deadwood extracts useful information from UDP DNS packets marked
   truncated which almost always removes the need to have
   DNS-over-TCP. However, Deadwood does not cache DNS packets
   larger than 512 bytes in size that need to be sent using TCP. In
   addition, DNS-over-TCP packets which are "incomplete" DNS
   replies (replies which a stub resolver can not use, which can be
   either a NS referral or an incomplete CNAME reply) are not
   handled correctly by Deadwood.

   Deadwood has support for both DNS-over-UDP and DNS-over-TCP; the
   same daemon listens on both the UDP and TCP DNS port.

   Only UDP DNS queries are cached. Deadwood does not support
   caching over TCP; it handles TCP to resolve the rare truncated
   reply without any useful information or to work with very
   uncommon non-RFC-compliant TCP-only DNS resolvers. In the real
   world, DNS-over-TCP is almost never used.

                         Parsing other files

   It is possible to have Deadwood, while parsing the dwood3rc
   file, read other files and parse them as if they were dwood3rc
   files.

   This is done using execfile. To use execfile, place a line like
   this in the dwood3rc file:

   execfile("path/to/filename")

   Where path/to/filename is the path to the file to be parsed like
   a dwood3rc file.

   All files must be in or under the directory
   /etc/deadwood/execfile. Filenames can only have lower-case
   letters and the underscore character ("_"). Absolute paths are
   not allowed as the argument to execfile; the filename can not
   start with a slash ("/") character.

   If there is a parse error in the file pointed to by execfile,
   Deadwood will report the error as being on the line with the
   execfile command in the main dwood3rc file. To find where a
   parse error is in the sub-file, use something like
   "Deadwood -f /etc/deadwood/execfile/filename" to find the parse
   error in the offending file, where "filename" is the file to to
   parsed via execfile.

                             IPV6 support

   This server can also be optionally compiled to have IPv6
   support. In order to enable IPv6 support, add '-DIPV6' to the
   compile-time flags. For example, to compile this to make a small

         export FLAGS='-Os -DIPV6'
         make

                               SECURITY

   Deadwood is a program written with security in mind.

   In addition to use a buffer-overflow resistant string library
   and a coding style and SQA process that checks for buffer
   overflows and memory leaks, Deadwood uses a strong pseudo-random
   number generator (The 32-bit version of RadioGatun) to generate
   both the query ID and source port. For the random number
   generator to be secure, Deadwood needs a good source of entropy;
   by default Deadwood will use /dev/urandom to get this entropy.
   If you are on a system without /dev/urandom support, it is
   important to make sure that Deadwood has a good source of
   entropy so that the query ID and source port are hard to guess
   (otherwise it is possible to forge DNS packets).

   The Windows port of Deadwood includes a program called
   "mkSecretTxt.exe" that creates a 64-byte (512 bit) random file
   called "secret.txt" that can be used by Deadwood (via the
   "random_seed_file" parameter); Deadwood also gets entropy from
   the timestamp when Deadwood is started and Deadwood's process ID
   number, so it is same to use the same static secret.txt file as
   the random_seed_file for multiple invocations of Deadwood.

   Note that Deadwood is not protected from someone on the same
   network viewing packets sent by Deadwood and sending forged
   packets as a reply.

   To protect Deadwood from certain possible denial-of-service
   attacks, it is best if Deadwood's prime number used for hashing
   elements in the cache is a random 31-bit prime number. The
   program RandomPrime.c generates a random prime that is placed in
   the file DwRandPrime.h that is regenerated whenever either the
   program is compiled or things are cleaned up with make clean.
   This program uses /dev/urandom for its entropy; the file
   DwRandPrime.h will not be regenerated on systems without
   /dev/urandom.

   On systems without direct /dev/urandom support, it is suggested
   to see if there is a possible way to give the system a working
   /dev/urandom. This way, when Deadwood is compiled, the hash
   magic number will be suitably random.

   If using a precompiled binary of Deadwood, please ensure that
   the system has /dev/urandom support (on Windows system, please
   ensure that the file with the name secret.txt is generated by
   the included mkSecretTxt.exe program); Deadwood, at runtime,
   uses /dev/urandom (secret.txt in Windows) as a hardcoded path to
   get entropy (along with the timestamp) for the hash algorithm.

                            DAEMONIZATION

   Deadwood does not have any built-in daemonization facilities;
   this is handled by the external program Duende or any other
   daemonizer.

                      Example configuration file

   Here is an example dwood3rc configuration file:

 # This is an example deadwood rc file
 # Note that comments are started by the hash symbol

 bind_address="127.0.0.1" # IP we bind to

 # The following line is disabled by being commented out
 #bind_address="::1" # We have optional IPv6 support

 # Directory we run program from (not used in Win32)
 chroot_dir = "/etc/deadwood"

 # The following upstream DNS servers are Google's
 # (as of December 2009) public DNS servers.  For
 # more information, see the page at
 # http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/
 #
 # If neither root_servers nor upstream_servers are set,
 # Deadwood will use the default ICANN root servers.
 #upstream_servers = {}
 #upstream_servers["."]="8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4"

 # Who is allowed to use the cache.  This line
 # allows anyone with "127.0" as the first two
 # digits of their IP to use Deadwood
 recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1/16"

 # Maximum number of pending requests
 maxprocs = 8

 # Send SERVER FAIL when overloaded
 handle_overload = 1

 maradns_uid = 99 # UID Deadwood runs as
 maradns_gid = 99 # GID Deadwood runs as

 maximum_cache_elements = 60000

 # If you want to read and write the cache from disk,
 # make sure chroot_dir above is readable and writable
 # by the maradns_uid/gid above, and uncomment the
 # following line.
 #cache_file = "dw_cache"

 # If your upstream DNS server converts "not there" DNS replies
 # in to IPs, this parameter allows Deadwood to convert any reply
 # with a given IP back in to a "not there" IP.  If any of the IPs
 # listed below are in a DNS answer, Deadwood converts the answer
 # in to a "not there"
 #ip_blacklist = "10.222.33.44, 10.222.3.55"

 # By default, for security reasons, Deadwood does not allow IPs in
 # the 192.168.x.x, 172.[16-31].x.x, 10.x.x.x, 127.x.x.x,
 # 169.254.x.x, 224.x.x.x, or 0.0.x.x range.  If using Deadwood
 # to resolve names on an internal network, uncomment the
 # following line:
 #filter_rfc1918 = 0

                                 BUGS

   Deadwood does not follow RFC2181's advice to ignore DNS
   responses with the TC (truncated) bit set, but instead extracts
   the first RR. If this is not desired, set the undocumented
   parameter truncation_hack to 0 (but read the DNS over TCP
   section of this man page).

   Deadwood can not process DNS resource record types with numbers
   between 65392 and 65407. These RR types are marked by the IANA
   for "private use"; Deadwood reserves these record types for
   internal use. This is only 16 record types out of the 65536
   possible DNS record types (only 71 have actually been assigned
   by IANA, so this is a non-issue in the real world).

   It is not clear whether the DNS RFCs allow ASCII control
   characters in DNS names. Even if they were, Deadwood does not
   allow ASCII control characters (bytes with a value less then 32)
   in DNS names. Other characters (UTF-8, etc.) are allowed.
