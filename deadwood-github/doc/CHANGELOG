3.2.05 (2014-02-11):

- Security update: Certain malformed DNS packets could crash Deadwood 
  (especially in Windows)

- Snapshot releases now in YYYY-MM-DD-N form

- Fixed cppcheck detected warnings and errors

- Default file name for entropy in Windows is now "secret.txt"

- dw_substr() bounds check updated

- More validation done with DNS packets sent to Deadwood

- Dashes can now be the first character of a black listed domain

3.2.04 (20131220):

- Security patch as described at http://samiam.org/blog/20131202.html

- One line patch so that whatever.scalzi.com resolves again.  More 
  information at http://cct2.vk.tj 

- Seven-line patch so mixed-case names correctly resolve.

- Fairly large patch to both speed up some DNS resolutions and to get
  oncetv-ipn.net to resolve again

- Added FAQ entry about Deadwood dropping RFC1918 addresses from replies

- Added FAQ entry about what causes "uninitialized dictionary
  variable" message

- Exit with fatal error when there is over 20,000 upstream/root server
  entries in dwood3rc (older Deadwood releases would silently not work)

- Compression is now case insensitive (smaller DNS packets)

- Expanded recursive_acl example to show multiple subnets

- Fixed warnings when compiled with clang 3.0

- d.root-servers.org moved from 128.8.10.90 to 199.7.91.13

- Cleanup of code in now-case-insensitive dwx_dname_issame()

- Cleanup of code that initializes "dns string" objects; make
  sure initialized values are 0

3.2.03d (20131202):

- Security patch as described at http://samiam.org/blog/20131202.html

3.2.03c (20130713):

- Seven-line patch so mixed-case names correctly resolve.

3.2.03b (20130501):

- Deadwood compiled in Windows with -Os and stripped

3.2.03a (20130423):

- One line patch so that whatever.scalzi.com resolves again.  More 
  information at http://cct2.vk.tj

3.2.03 (20121220):

- Added a whole bunch of security validation to DwCompress.c (always
  make sure offsets are within bounds)

- Deadwood now compiles with IPv6 support again

- We now handle EasyDNS' bad truncation in a reasonable manner

- Added new SQA test for es-us.noticias.yahoo.com issue in May/June 2012

- Replaced "malloc" with "dw_malloc" wrapper (make it a little easier
  for embedded devs)

- Updated INSTALL.txt (Windows 7; Deadwood's malloc use)

- There is now a compile-time flag (-DSHOWPACKET) to see every single
  packet Deadwood receives (for debugging)

- If /etc/deadwood is missing, we now tell them what the missing directory is

- Made the underlying RNG a little faster and about 50 bytes smaller
  (I like keeping the Windows binary under 65,536 bytes in size)

- Documented the difference between a string, numeric, and dictionary parameter

- If the Deadwood cache file is older than the dwood3rc file, do not
  load the cache

- SQA update: Netstat changed, breaking one of the SQA tests. These
  SQA tests have been updated to pass again (and should work when run
  against an older netstat)

- SQA update: Sometimes the ttl ages one second, which made one of the
  tests sometimes fail.

- OS Update: The supported OSes for Deadwood are now CentOS/RedHat 6 and
  Windows 7

3.2.02 (20120229):

* New dwood3rc parameter added: max_ttl

* Documentation updates: "Recursive-algorithm" document added, INSTALL.TXT
  updated, etc.

3.2.01 (20120211):

* Bugfix: Deadwood no longer causes the TTL of a record to be at least
  30 seconds long when fetching it from the cache.

* SQA test for "TTL updated to 30 seconds" bug (sqa_ttl_expire) added

* Test for seeing how well Deadwood resolves the "Alexa top 500" added

* Improvements determining when records expire from the cache

* Default num_retries increased from 2 to 5 (improves number of DNS records
  Deadwood correctly resolves on the first attempt; trades speed for 
  accuracy)

* DNS-over-TCP connections given more time to resolve

* Numerous documentation updates: Updated FAQ, HTML version of documents
  added, Example dwood3rc file showing all parameters added, etc.

3.1.03 (20111221):

* Bugfix: Deadwood uses the TTL from upstream for incomplete CNAME referrals
  instead of having it hard-coded to be 60 seconds long.

* Bugfix: The dwd_nextkey() associative array/dictionary iterator now uses
  dwh_hash_compress() to find the hash bucket for our hash key, which makes
  hash iterations run in O(n) instead of O(n^2) operations (n being the 
  hash size).  In plain English, Deadwood will now not bog down parsing 
  dwood3rc files with large dictionaries.

* Resolution speed optimization: Deadwood now uses either the POSIX-compliant 
  clock_gettime() call in Linux or Windows' GetSystemTimeAsFileTime() call 
  in order to have fraction-of-a-second timestamps (which speed up resolution
  when a remote server is not replying to our query). For systems without 
  clock_gettime() (such as Mac OS X), Makefile.fallback has been added.

3.1.02 (20111127):

Hotfix: Deadwood 3.1.01 did not correctly initialize all pointers with NULL 
(0 in the source code since NULL is always 0 in C) resulting in invalid
pointer dereference crashes.

3.1.01 (20111127):

* Bugfix: We now favor glued over glueless records so as to not fall in
  to a "tarpit" where we keep chasing the same glueless records over and 
  over.

* Bugfix: Truncation hack now correctly sets NSCOUNT and ARCOUNT to 0.
  This speeds up resolving yahoo.com hosts.

* Code size optimization: reset_rem() is now a function instead of an
  inline.  Reduces -Os size of 32-bit Windows binary by some 3k.

* Code size optimization: Optional TINY_BINARY compile flag which makes
  the binary a little smaller by removing some of the parsing rules.

* Resolution speed optimization: We now look for a cached incomplete
  CNAME record and will use it if available.  This should speed up 
  resolution when there is a high-TTL incomplete CNAME record pointing 
  to a low-TTL record.  As it turns out, this update doesn't change the
  binary format for the cache file.

3.0.05 (20111110):

* Bugfix: reject_ptr now works

* Bugfix: Replies from reject_aaaa and reject_ptr now have RA set, so
  that they work with Linux's stub DNS resolver.

3.0.04 (20111101):

* Bugfix: RD should now be correctly set (or cleared) when sending a query
          upstream.

* Parser update: upstream_servers and root_servers nodes can not be 
  newly defined more than once.

* Parser update: dwood3rc files can no longer have leading whitespace before
  definitions.

* Parser update: Dictionary variables can no longer be initialized twice

* SQA update: 2 new SQA tests added (sqa_root_upstream: Make sure we can have
  both set in the same dwood3rc file; sqa_server_fail: Make sure 
  upstream_servers works when one of the two upstream servers is returning
  a SERVER FAIL); SQA tests updated to pass in both CentOS 5 and Scientific
  Linux 6.

* It is no longer possible to have a bind_address that is not in one's
  recursive_acl

* filter_rfc1918 parameter added to example dwood3rc file

* reject_ptr parameter added; both reject_aaaa and reject_ptr now immediately
  return a "not there" (instead of waiting for a reply upstream)

* Deadwood-HOWTO and UPDATE-guide added to documentation

3.0.03 (20110722):

* Bugfix: answers.yahoo.com problem fixed (we now extract one useful 
  	answer from a truncated reply if it is there)

* Bugfix: Domains where one of the nameservers give a "QUERY REFUSED"
	correctly handled unless we are asking for an AAAA IPv6 IP
	(since some broken DNS servers respond to AAAA requests with
	 "QUERY REFUSED")

* Bugfix: RA is no longer set when sending recursive queries 

* Bugfix: Synthetic "not there" replies are now correctly formed
  DNS packets.

* SQA tests updated for new example.com data and for Scientific Linux 6

* Example dwood3rc file updated to show how to blacklist domains

3.0.02 (20110128):

* Bugfix: "www.urbandictionary.com" resolves again

* Bugfix: filter_rfc1918 parameter now filters more IPv4 DNS answers that
  might be exploitable.

* Third party feature: Yarin has added "--pid" support to "duende"

3.0.01 (20100924):

* dwood3rc parser fixes: Dictionary elements now must be initialized; 
  referring non-existent dictionary elements is a fatal parse error; 
  dictionary elements can not be appended without being first set; the
  += operator correctly works with dictionary elements in Deadwood.

* ej tools updated to run without warnings with newer versions of Perl and
  to use elinks if "links" is not a symlink to elinks

* "install.bat" and "uninstall.bat" files to give Deadwood a one-click
  (un)install in Windows XP and a simpler install in Windows Vista/7

* Documentation and FAQ updates

2.9.07 (20100909):

* Hash core updated to get entropy from /dev/urandom (secret.txt in Windows)
  in order to have the hash compression function generate different hash 
  compression values every time Deadwood is run.

* Two bugs slowing down Deadwood's performance have been fixed: 1) Deadwood
  no longer stalls timeout_seconds if an error getting an upstream address
  occurs; 2) Deadwood no longer stalls timeout_seconds if it gets a reply
  upstream that has upper-case letters in its name.

* A long standing bug that caused Deadwood to be unable to resolve MX
  queries has been fixed (I fixed it as soon as I found out about the 
  bug).

* Likewise, MX queries are now disabled in Deadwood unless explicitly
  enabled (Deadwood has worked fine for over a year with MX records broken,
  and they are the type of query only mail hubs and spam zombies will 
  make)

* Slight tweaking of log messages to be more accurate and informative.

* Documentation updates: FAQ added to point out Gibson's dnsbench tool is 
  buggy and does not accurately reflect Deadwood's performance; man page
  updated to reflect changes to dwood3rc parameters

2.9.06 (20100903):

* Documentation updates

* Some unused library routines trimmed from Deadwood via OTHER_STUFF
  compile-time flag

* All references to obsolete deliver_all variable removed from source code

* Tuned handling of empty DNS packets: Empty DNS packets are now treated
  like low-TTL "not there" replies unless the RCODE is "SERVER FAIL"; in
  that case, empty DNS packets are ignored.

2.9.05 (20100820):

* Workaround for broken behavior with www.bookride.com's DNS server where
  a CNAME referral is incorrectly marked as a NXDOMAIN

* ANY queries that point to CNAMEs now work in Deadwood

* check_ip_acl speeded up by breaking out of its loop when we get past
  the last user-defined ACL

* mkSecretTxt file added to Windows port of Deadwood ; its source is in
  tools/

* doc/internals updated for Deadwood 2.9 

* compile.options now lists all #ifdef flags in Deadwood's source

* INSTALL.txt updated to point out we are now using MinGW 3.4.2; 
  Makefile.mingw310 now called Makefile.mingw342

2.9.04 (20100813):

* Updated EDNS handling to treat EDNS packets as if the OPT record does not
  exist and we're getting a RFC1035 DNS packet.  If the behavior of returning
  NOTIMPL to EDNS packets is preferred, this can be enabled by defining
  "STRICT_RFC2671_COMPLIANCE" when compiling Deadwood.

* DNS queries are now case-insensitive, with case preserved for the query
  originally sent to Deadwood (just in case a stub resolver violates RFC1035
  and is case sensitive)

* Default timeout_seconds is now 2, no longer 3

* The highest maxprocs is now 16,384, not 1,024

2.9.03 (20100806):

* Updated dwood2rc_n_timeout_seconds SQA test to work around CentOS bug
  (reported: http://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=4465 )

* Got packets too big to fit in dns-over-udp to work when running
  Deadwood as a recursive nameserver

* Fix IPs in ACLs without netmasks

* Increase timeout when a child query is spawned

* Add new compile-time define: XTRA_STUFF for routines only used while
  debugging.

* Deadwood can now handle a DNS reply with a DNAME in it

* Retries and remote IPs we connect to are are now logged at verbose_level
  128 or higher

* Deadwood now sends NOTIMPL in reply to EDNS packets instead of dropping 
  them

2.9.02 (20100729):

* Script to apply patches against one version of Deadwood to make the
	next Deadwood release made (based on similar MaraDNS script)

* INSTALL.txt updated to not mention DwMain (Deadwood's older name)

* DW_MAXIPS increased to 128

* Spurious debug message removed

* Documentation updates (root_servers more fully described in man page;
	more questions and answers added to FAQ)

* Bug reporting policy update (you better have a stack trace or be able 
	to reproduce a crash; otherwise I can't use the bug report)

* Issue getting "SERVER FAIL" when AAAA query points to non-existent
	AAAA fixed.

* Issue when we get a "a.kabah.foo CNAME b.kabah.foo ; c.kabah.foo A 10.2.3.4"
	packet (where "b.kabah.foo" is a CNAME for "c.kabah.foo") fixed.

2.9.01 (20100722): 

FAQ added.

Deadwood cache format changed to have 'DW3' (Deadwood 3) instead of 
'DX2' (Deadwood eXperimental version 2) magic ID in header; next 32-bit
number is now 0 (and ignored when reading) instead of maximum cache size.

Documentation updated to reflect the fact that Deadwood is now fully
recursive. 

Deadwood passes all SQA regressions.

20100722-1:

Bugfix: dwx_make_one_cname_rr() can now create a string with a maximum
	length greater then 260 (dw_get_dname() also had to be updated).

Bugfix: dwx_create_cname_reply() did not correctly set offsets for CNAME
	pointers after the first one.  Fixed.

www.gbod.org now resolves in Deadwood (finally!), as well as t7.tagstat.com.

Seems to do well with the "browsing test", albeit a bit slowly.

20100720-2:

Bugfix: make_new_udp_connect() called make_remote_connection before 
	allocating memory for rem[b].local, making the connection in
	question incorrectly look available.  Fixed.

20100720-1:

Bugfix: We end a connection to solve a glueless NS query after we send the
	IP for the NS upstream (one-character change).

20100718-2:

Added support for MaraDNS' "reject_aaaa" parameter

We now cycle through possible name servers if connecting to one fails, 
instead of always choosing one at random.

20100718-1:

CNAME records that point to "not there" or NXDOMAIN replies are now placed 
in the cache as dangling CNAME records.

2.6.05 (20100717):

All regression tests in the sqa/ directory pass, both for 32-bit and 64-bit
CentOS 5.

Bugfixes: 

* dw_substr was able to dereference a NULL pointer.  Fixed.

* dwc_rr_rotate would sometimes not set out_start and out_end if non-NULL.
	Fixed.

20100715-2:

sqa_rg32 now has all official RadioGatun[32] test vectors.

Dieharder tests performed to verify that RadioGatun[32] creates high-quality
unbiased random numbers (this was actually done a few days ago)

Bugfix: We now no longer send out glueless CNAME queries when a glueless CNAME
	is completed.

20100715-1:

New SQA test in progress: recurse_2link_cname

ANY queries now work with recursion.

20100714-1:

New function: dwx_send_glueless_cname_upstream(), called only from
	dwx_make_cname_reply()

20100713-1:

Bugfixes: 

* dwx_make_cname_reply() now recursively handles multi-link CNAME chains

* dwx_create_cname_reply() now gives dwx_make_one_cname_rr() the correct 
	offset for CNAME pointers after the first one.

20100711-1:

Bugfixes:

* Issues caused by dwx_do_glueless_new() calling dwx_do_glueless_new() (via
 	make_remote_connection() ) resolved

* Issues with dwc_rotate_rr being used to determine length of answer
	resolved

2.6.04 (20100706): 

Testing updates:

* dwood2rc_n_timeout_seconds had to be disabled in CentOS 5.5 because
	some CentOS 5.5 bug makes this fail (the test passes in CentOS 5.4,
	and the test in Deadwood 2.6.03 fails in CentOS 5.5)

* sqa_valgrind and dwood2rc_n_max_inflights updated for Valgrind's revised
	output in CentOS 5.5 (and have alternate output for the older Valgrind
	used in CentOS 5.3 for the 64-bit tests)

* basic_ipv6_test adds /sbin to PATH so it will work on a stock CentOS
	5.5 without /sbin in one's path (ifconfig is there)

SQA test suite now passes in CentOS 5.5 (except for dwood2rc_n_timeout_seconds
as described above).

20100706-1:

Incomplete CNAME replies are now fully working.

20100704-1:

CNAME replies now work if the query the CNAME points to is already 
cached.

20100629-2:

Abstracted code that creates new query for solving glueless NS referrals to
also be used to solve an incomplete CNAME referral.

Bugfix: NS referrals are now correctly cached. (I forgot to add the 65395
pseudo-type)

20100629-1:

Updated "no glueless CNAME" message to give us the name we are trying 
to resolve instead of where its CNAME points.

2.6.03 (20100626):

Windows 32 Mingw compile fixed; All SQA tests pass in CentOS 5 32-bit and
64-bit.

20100626-1:

Bugfix: send_reply_from_cache now sends reply from local, not remote, 
	connection

20100625-2:

"All tests successful", but I want to know why we're getting those
"unexpected" answers from dig before releasing 2.6.03.

20100624-2:

Valgrind is now happy when I make a recursive query which involves resolving
a glueless NS referral.

20100624-1:

Glueless NS referrals now work.  Next: Make sure Valgrind is happy when
resolving a glueless NS referral, then make sure Deadwood passes all
tests, then release Deadwood 2.6.03.

20100621-1:

Work on getting gluless NS referrals to work.

Memory leak in handle_resurrections plugged

20100619-1:

Writing up NOTES to have a roadmap for implmenting glueless NS solving.

20100618-1:

dwx_ns_getip_glueless now returns a glueless NS referral; now I need to have
make_remote_connection() or something calling it to make a new query when
a NS referral is received.

20100531-1:

New dwood3rc parameter: ns_glueless_type

Deadwood can now resolve glueless NS records if we already have the
NS record in the cache.

chain_id removed and replaced by "glueless" string.

20100527-2:

Three parameters added to remote_T so we can do glueless NS records and
incomplete CNAME chains: recurse_depth, parent_id, and chain_id

20100527-1:

We now use send_reply_from_cache() instead of forward_remote_reply() 
after caching a reply; this way, we always send to the end user the
reply as it exists in the cache (this also means Deadwood now has
to cache all DNS packets; no more 0-ttl support).

20100526-1:

Added send_reply_from_cache(), which will be used by get_rem_udp_packet_core()
as a wrapper for get_reply_from_cache() so we always send the client the
DNS packet as it looks like in the cache (so our security checks and filters
in DwRecurse.c can be used).  

Next: Debug send_reply_from_cache()

Replaced all tabs with white space in Deadwood's source code.

20100525-2:

Bugfix: Closing a socket before marking it "invalid" is always a good idea. :)

Minimum TTL for DNS entries is now 30 seconds; minimum TTL for NS referrals
is 3600 seconds (one hour); we make NS referrals have a longer TTL for
security reasons.

20100525-1:

Bugfix: We no longer wait timeout_seconds every time we send a packet
based on a NS referral

2.6.02 (20100524):

All SQA tests pass in 64-bit CentOS 5.3

20100524-1:

sqa/do.tests updated to allow a given test to be tried multiple times
(this is configured on a per-test basis) before giving up.

References to DwMain in DwMain.c renamed to Deadwood, and all tests 
updated to reflect this change.

Memory leak in DwRecurse.c plugged (valgrind is your friend)

All sqa tests pass in 32-bit virtual machine.

20100521-2:

We now log warnings when people try to use Deadwood 2.6.02 to
follow glueless referrals.

20100521-1:

Bugfix: RD is now correctly either 0 or 1 in retries over TCP after 
getting a truncated packet.

20100520-1:

RD should now be set to 0 unless we contacted an upstream server; if we
have contacted an upstream server and get a referral, the referral should
now be ignored.

20100519-2:

OK, non-glueless NS referrals now *work*.  In other words, I can resolve
google.com (whose resolution doesn't need to follow any glueless referrals)
starting from the root servers.  In other words, after two years, Deadwood
is finally starting to have real recursion.

Bugfix: Records are cached again (dwx_dissect_packet() was destroying 
	bailiwick string, which it no longer should do)

Bugfix: IPs in root_servers and upstream_servers dwood3rc variables can now
	have trailing whitespace (via new dwx_zap_whitespace() function)

20100519-1:

Code for glued NS referrals written; now time to debug it.

20100514-1:

We now only extract the dname part of a name from the bailiwick in 
dwx_ns_convert().

Bailiwick checks added to dwx_cache_reply().

Work has begun on dwx_handle_ns_refer(); when this is finished, we will
be able to, starting from the root servers, handle DNS queries which
do not require glueless NS referrals.

20100513-2:

INSTALL.txt updated to use "Deadwood" as the name of the compiled binary
and Deadwood.1 as the file with the *ROFF man page.

Begin work to have code in DwRecurse.c to update the NS list and send
another query when we get a NS referral list from upstream.

20100513-1:

dwx_ns_convert now has third bailiwick parameter: The bailiwick for this
synthetic NS referral.

20100512-1:

Updated example IPv6 addresses to use RFC4193-compliant fd4d:6172:6144:4e53
prefix.

20100503-2:

Each query now has its own list of NS servers to contact; this allows us to
revise the list and reset the timeout if we get a NS referral record.

20100503-1:

Deadwood now uses both upstream_servers and root_servers; if neither is
set, Deadwood uses the list of ICANN IPv4 root servers as the default
root servers (but we don't have full recursion yet).

20100430-1:

get_upstream_ip() now fetches upstream IP from main cache; 
	process_upstream_servers() puts elements in main cache.

Immutable elements in hash are now properly immutable (TTL ignored, not
	used in fila, etc.)

New element added to ip_addr_T: Flags (this will be used to indicate that
	a given NS delegation is upstream instead of root).

20100429-2:

Bugfix: we put TYPE_UPSTREAM_REFER in the footer of the NS reference in
	dwx_ns_convert() if is_upstream has a value of 1

#ifdef wrapper added to DwRadioGatun.h (so we can define it in multiple
	places without it making things not compile)

dwx_ns_getip() finished (except for dwx_ns_getip_glueless(), which we will
	deal with once we're grabbing IPs from the main cache instead of
	the soon-to-be-removed upstream_dict variable)

Next: Have get_upstream_ip() fetch the upstream IP from the main cache
	instead of from upstream_dict; rewrite to use dwx_ns_getip();
	also revise process_upstream_servers() to put data in main
	cache hash as immutables.

20100429-1:

dwx_ns_convert() finished and makes the type of strings we use for NS
referrals.

Placeholder to put dw_string in ip_addr_T added (this way, we can pop either
an IP or a glueless DNS name from this)

Debug messages removed; that code is tested and works.

Code is a working non-recursive cache again.

Next: dwx_ns_getip() function; given a NS referral string, pop a random IP from
	the string, returning it in ip_addr_T form, or a glueless DNS name.

20100428-2:

Two new fields added to remote_T (a pending remote connecton):

	* "ns", which is a list of upstream NS servers we are trying to
	  contact

	* "is_upstream"; if this is 1, the server we are trying to contact
	  is an "upstream" server (set "RD" bit; do not send any more queries
	  if we get an incomplete reply from them)

DwRecurse.h and DwDnsStr.h have "this defined" macro added so they can more
easily be include'd in other files without worrying about parsing the file
more than once.

Proper function prototypes for dwx_cache_reply() and dwx_ns_convert() in
DwRecurse.h (the two, if you will, public functions in this file).

Begin work on dwx_ns_convert()

Next: Finish dwx_ns_convert()

20100428-1:

dwood2rc file is now dwood3rc file (we're moving towards Deadwood 3)

"immutable" elements added to underlying hash

20100427-1:

dw_fetch_u8() modified to return the last byte of a string if offset is -1.

deliver_all support removed; this doesn't make sense to have with full
recursion.

dwx_cache_reply() now returns the type of reply we got upstream

Begin work in DwUdpSocket.c to handle "incomplete" replies.

20100422-1:

One-line change to DwRecurse.h; yes Deadwood is alive again (I had a 
contract; the contract said I was to be paid every month.  I haven't 
been paid for my first month of work, so back to Deadwood)

20100305-1:

Minor updates to DwRecurse.h and this changelog.

2.5.02 (20100305):

Backport of fix for improper rdlengths in uncompressed packets to 
now-stable 2.5 branch of Deadwood.

2.6.01 (20100303):

All 64-bit SQA tests pass, TCC compile test passes.  Time to get 2.6.01 
out of the door.

20100303-2:

OK, all SQA tests pass.  Time to verify they pass, do the 64-bit and TCC
tests, and release Deadwood 2.6.01.

20100303-1:

All sqa tests modified or bugs in program fixed so that the tests past, 
with the exception of the "sqa_tcp_buffering_2" test.

20100302-1:

dwx_make_cache_string() implemented; bug in dwx_remake_complete_reply()
fixed (wrong offsets for NS section records); dwx_dissect_packet() now
determines type based on whether we got the NXDOMAIN bit set in the header.

Deadwood now caches replies massaged by dwx_dissect_packet(); I will test
this some and then release Deadwood 2.6.01.

20100301-2:

dwx_make_ns_refer() revised to have the resulting string start off with
a single DLABEL telling us what records in the DNS space (such as
.com, samiam.org or what not) this packet is a NS referral for.

The rule is that the longest NS record (the one which covers the least
amount of DNS space) which is in-bailiwick is selected to determine how much
of the DNS space the NS packet covers.

20100301-1:

Updated INSTALL.txt to be current with post-2.3 Deadwood changes.

dwx_remake_complete_reply(), which remakes a "complete" NS reply with all 
records which do not directly answer the question removed, implemented.

Next: Make sure we handle NXDOMAIN replies correctly, then have it so
Deadwood puts dwx_cache_reply()-made answers in to the cache.

20100226-1:

Progress made on dwx_remake_complete_reply().  Next: Finish the
	dwx_copy_over_section() code.

20100225-1:

dwx_make_ns_refer() implemented; this creates a string stored in the cache
for an incomplete NS referral.

20100224-1:

dwx_make_cname_refer() implemented; this creates a string stored in the 
cache for an incomplete CNAME referral.

20100223-2:

Bug fix (which should be applied to stable 2.5 branch of Deadwood):
Compression code had incorrect RDLENGTH in decompressed packet when the
first packet had a DNS label that wasn't a compression pointer.  

This actually doesn't cause any problems in Deadwood 2.4/2.5 because the
RDLENGTH has the correct value again when we recompress the string
before sending it over the wire (see dwc_compress_rr() where it says
"dw_put_u16(c,c->len - rdold,rdold - 2);"), but it's best to fix this
bug.

dwx_stdout_dns_packet() implemented; this will allow Deadwood to be run
thusly when there's a DNS name Deadwood is having a hard time resolving
correctly:

	Deadwood --solve www.poorly-done.dns.name.foo

The idea is to implement things so if Deadwood is run this way, it will
interactively try and solve the DNS name in question, showing why it is
we're having a hard time trying to resolve it.

20100223-1:

Added and tested new function: dwx_determine_answer_type()

Also fixed bug with handling negative (sometimes NXDOMAIN) DNS replies.

Next: Make the string with the action to perform.

20100218-1:

dwx_get_1_dns_rr() function added (but not tested).  Given a dw_str 
object (dw_str: Deadwood string), and a offset where we start looking
in that string where a DNS packet starts, we get a single DNS rr from
the DNS packet.

20100209-1:

dwx_check_bailiwick_ns_section() added; Bailiwick check added and 
appears to work.

Next: Have code figure out what to do next when getting a DNS reply
	(Complete DNS answer; CNAME referral or list of possible nameservers
 	 to go to next).

20100204-1:

dwx_string_bailiwick_top() implemented and dwx_string_in_bailiwick()
finished; now I have to test the bailiwick code.

20100203-1:

dwx_string_bailiwick_query() implemented; 1/2 of the Bailiwick check for
NS records.

20100127-1:

Routines added to mark unneeded junk to remove from DNS reply packets;
routines added to link NS referrals in the NS section with AR referrals
in the AR section.

Next: Bailiwick checks.

20100126-3:

Clean up to dwx_check_answer_section(): We now no longer allow CNAMEs after
finding a direct answer to our query, only allow CNAME chains at the top of
the AN section of a reply, and no longer allow CNAMEs after an answer to
our reply at the end of a CNAME chain.

20100126-2:

Added dwx_check_answer_section() to mark responses in the AN which are not 
a direct answer to our query or a CNAME chain leading to a direct response 
to our query as RRX_IGNORE (ignore this answer).

20100126-1:

More work on being able to grok DNS strings so we can do full recursion.

20100125: 

Begin work in DwRecurse.c to look at a DNS reply and, from the reply,
determine how to proceed.

2.5.01 (20100122):

Testing release with filter_rfc1918 and TCC support.

20100121:

dw_destroy now resets values in dw_str object, to minimize chance
of a freed string causing problems.

20100120:

sqa test added for and bug fixed with filter_rfc1918

20100119:

has_bad_ip renamed dwc_has_bad_ip (Since we're in lowly C, let's try to
avoid namespace collisions)

New parameter added: filter_rfc1918, which filters out RFC1918 (local)
	IP addresses from DNS replies.  Documented; SQA tests updated
	to have "filter_rfc1918 = 0".

20100104:

DwUdpSocket.c has one-line fix to compile with TCC.

tcc-compile.bat script added.

2.4.10 (20091219):

Documentation touch-up in preparation for MaraDNS 1.4.01 being released
Monday (December 21)

2.4.09 (20091211):

20091206 snapshot given 2.4.09 name; I'm getting ready to split off
and work on the recursive code.

20091206:

The default public DNS servers in the documentation and example dwood2rc
files are Google's newly announced public DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)

20091202:

Bugfix: dw_log_dwstr() and dw_log_dwstr_str() no longer add newlines at
	all verbose_level settings.

All DNS queries and replies notes at log level 100 (I'm trying to see why
I sometimes can't find hosts when using Deadwood at work)

20091130:

Windows reference text file updated to have all new 2.4 dwood2rc variables
documented.

2.4.08 (20091111):

Makefile for Cygwin added; note added to INSTALL.txt mentioning
unsupported operating systems.

Documentation updated; internals hasn't (by and large) been touched since
2007 so I updated it to note the improvments I have been making in 2009.

20091111-1:

All tests pass in 32-bit CentOS 5 virtual machine.  Now, have tests 
pass in 64-bit CentOS 5 and release Deadwood 2.4.08.

20091110-1:

dwood2rc parser now reports an incomplete last line as such, instead of
as a vague syntax error.

INSTALL.txt updated to clarify you need to enter the "src/" directory
to compile Deadwood in Windows.

20091022-1:

Documentation fully updated to reflect new deliver_all parameter.

20091021-S and 20091021-1:

Deadwood will now forward on DNS packets upstream which it thinks are
invalid packets, since some DNS servers send "name error" packets without
a SOA record in the NS section of the reply.

I would like to thank Jakob Blomer at CERN laboratories for reporting
this problem.

20090929-1:

doc/internals/ROADMAP revised to have detailed plan to perform the next
step in making Deadwood fully recursive.  

Windows binary for this release made; no need to run it under GDB (no
crashes seen for weeks and I have other reports Deadwood is very
stable)

20090920-1:

Improvements to dwx_dname_issame()

20090919-1:

dwx_dname_issame() implemented

20090909-1:

Added new (currently blank) file: DwRecurse.c, which will contain routines
used only by the fully recursive code.

20090905-1:

Revised code to see if it fixes a possible once-in-a-blue-moon crash 
Deadwood might have.

2.4.07 (20090831):

All tests pass.  2.4.07 released with execfile() and inflight merge
support.

20090830-3:

Multiple inflight segfault found and removed.

max_inflights test finished.

20090830-2:

More work on SQA test done.

20090830-1:

max_inflights parameter documented.

Work on making tests that make sure inflight merging works set up.

20090828-1:

The code hasn't been tested, but Deadwood should now have multiple
inflight query support.

Next: Test the code (make a custom DNS server that takes a few seconds to 
      reply and increase Deadwood's timeout in the test)

20090827-1:

Code to initialize inflight hash added.

20090826-2:

max_inflights dwood2rc variable added (but not documented)

Code now dynaically allocates in-flight DNS requests.

Next: Work on the code to merge in-flight DNS requests.

20090826-1:

Code revamped to send replies to multiple local connections waiting
when we get a reply.

Next: Revamp the code to allocate and free memory for multiple connections
for each new connection.

Note: When looking over the code, I realized there never was a problem
with not sending a new query ID when resending a DNS query.  So, there's
no reason to release Deadwood 2.3.05 yet.

20090824-S:

Backport of fix where we now send a new query ID when resending a
DNS query.

20090824-1:

Doing work on being able to merge multiple in-flight requests together.
As I looked over the code, I realized some things didn't work with 
DNS-over-TCP (resurrections, blacklist_ip), which I think I have fixed
(but I'm not going to test this; DNS-over-TCP is a bad hack).

In addition, the code that resent queries when we didn't hear from upstream
has been revamped to create a new query ID number every time we resend the
query, instead of echoing the local query ID.  This is something I
am also fixing in Deadwood 2.3.

One issue is that, sometimes we will need to keep the DNS-over-TCP
connections around while the DNS-over-UDP connections have died.  I've
redone forward_remote_reply() so that, once this routine sends a UDP
reply, it resets that particular local UDP connection so it won't send
a reply again.  This will hopefully solve the multiple DNS-over-TCP
issue.  

One possible workaround is to have it so DNS-over-TCP connections simply
don't look for in-flight requests, but always open up a new request.  I'll
also do this, but put some things in place so we could have both UDP and TCP
on the same connection number if this is desirable in the future.

20090823-1:

Final touch up to execfile: Added to Windows doc, doc now points out
only lower-case letters are allowed in a filename, and doc example of
"Deadwood -f /etc/deadwood/execfile/filename" is always on the same line.

&nbsp; support added to ej doc source format (it's treated as a simple
space when making the *roff man page source).

20090822-1:

execfile("name") no longer allows absolute paths; if execfile("name") is
done, all files must be under /etc/deadwood/execfile.  

execfile feature documented.

I will not set up better error reporting; it is time to go back to
handling multiple in-flight requests as one request.

20090821: 

Work on getting execfile("name") in dwood2rc file started.

To do:

* Security; make sure chroot_dir is set before execfile("name"); make
  sure "name" doesn't have any leading slashes.

* Better error reporting: Set up things so we correctly report errors
  in a subfile with execfile("name").

2.4.06 (20090820):

Coding style fix: dw_get_dname_type() now split off, which most of its guts
in dw_get_dname().

20090819-2:

More work fixing little things in the code so all SQA tests 
succeed.

20090819-1:

ip_blacklist now has IPv6 support.

Bugfix: Synthetic "not there" reply now correctly echoes DNS ID

SQA regression for ip_blacklist added

20090818-1:

ip_blacklist now returns synthetic "not there" replies.

Copying.txt file added to documentation.

20090817-1:

New dwood2rc parameter: ip_blacklist.  Should an IP appear in an answer
that is in the ip_blacklist, Deadwood will reject the answer.  I have
implemented this feature because there are security implications with
the practice some ISPs have of taking NXDOMAINs and redirecting them
to a web page with ads:

	http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/04/isps-error-page/

Since Deadwood is security-aware, I now have a workaround to alleviate
this security problem.

Right now, Deadwood just treats an answer with a blacklisted IP as an
error.  In addition, IPv6 IPs aren't supported (well, they're supported
in some parts of the new code but not all of it).

So, before I wrap up this feature, I need to make these kinds of answers
proper "nothere" replies (not actual NXDOMAINs for technical reasons),
add IPv6 support, add a SQA regression, then I'm done (I've already
documented it).

20090814-1:

I've updated the data structures for pending local connections to make
it possible for a given query to have multiple local connections.  Now,
I have to revise all of the code with local[0] to iterate through all
connections to send a reply to everyone who sent a given query when we
get the reply from upstream.

20090810-1:

Last references to the "DeadwoodTCP" service used in Deadwood 2.3 removed
from Windows README.txt

2.4.05 (20090809):

Tests run in 64-bit CentOS (x86_64); Windows documentation updated to
reflect Deadwood 2.4 changes and to note Windows 7 compatibility.

20090808-2:

All SQA tests pass.

20090808-1:

Deadwood passes all SQA tests; man page updated to name program "Deadwood"
instead of "DwMain".

20090803-2:

TTL aging support added.  ttl_age dwood2rc variable added to make it
possible to disable TTL aging.

20090803-1:

max_ar_chain dwood2rc variable added to make it possible to disable
resource record rotation.

20090802-1:

Bugfix: resource records with a TTL greater than two days now correctly 
rotate.

20090731-1:

Executable now called Deadwood when compiled in CentOS 5.

RR rotation now works.

20090730-1:

dwc_convert_dns_str() function addded, that converts a dns_string object
back in to a flat uncompressed DNS string.  Currently unused and not compiled
in to code by default.

dwc_get_type() function added.  Work on RR rotation continues.

20090728-1:

New source files: DwDnsStr.c and DwDnsStr.h, which handle DNS string 
objects (used by DwCompress.c, but this also allows things like RR rotation
and TTL aging to be more easily done).

20090724-1:

Note: *This revision of Deadwood stores cache data in a new format that
is incompatible with older Deadwood cache files* 

Packets are now stored in memory and on disk in uncompressed format.

20090723-1:

dw_rotate() function added.

20090721-1:

sqa_tcp test updated; all SQA tests now pass again.

2.4.04 (20090720):

We now only log strings where the answer is a valid string, but
the string was not correctly decompressed-then-compressed.  (To do:
Why is answer NULL for those DNS queries?)

20090718-1:

Removed a place where I forgot to make sure a value was not null before
printing out the value.

20090717-1:

Hardening of compression core done; all leaks and warnings removed when
run with Valgrind.

20090703-1:

Bugfix: Question can be longer than answer without problem decompressing
	packet.

Bugfix: DwSys.c function for logging dwstr objects escapes more ASCII
	characters that can cause problems when putting the strings in
	C source code

Bugfix: Some DNS packets are longer than 1024 bytes when decompressed;
	maximum allowed decompressed DNS packet expanded to 2048 bytes

Debug messages no longer log every query we make (note to self: Blacklist
www.vmware.com so VMware player no longer can figure out when it's time
to upgrade the player and annoy me)

20090702-3:

Bugfix: Program no longer segfaults if dw_str object is null in dw_log_dwstr_p
function.

20090702-2:

Some bugfixes with dwc_compress().

Testing release: The compression code does not affect packets coming to
and from the resolver.  However, every time Deadwood gets a DNS packet,
it decompresses then recompresses the packet.  If the recompressed packet
differs from the packet received from the upstream DNS server, Deadwood
logs a "WARNING: Compression problems with packet" error, followed by
the DNS packet causing problems.  This log message is then followed by
the length of the compressed packet, the packet as actually compressed
by Deadwood, and finally the string value and length of the question.

This allows me (and anyone who wishes to help) to test Deadwood's compression
core with real-world DNS packets.  In addition, I will make some acid tests
for the compression core (tests like making sure we never compress SRV 
RRs but can understand packets with compressed SRV records, etc.) which I
will use to further test Deadwood's compression core with.

20090702-1:

dwc_compress() now works for a very basic decompressed dw_string I tested 
Deadwood's new compression code against.

Next: Come up with some nasty compression tests

20090630-2:

dwc_compress() written.  Now, I have to debug all of the compression
code.

20090630-1:

dwc_compress_dlabels() written.

20090629-1:

More work on the compression code; we're getting closer and closer to 
finishing this up.

20090626-1:

Finished up code that converts an uncompressed DNS packet in to a "dns_string"
object.  Next: Finish up the compression code.

20090625-1:

New object type: dns_string; a DNS packet with metadata that makes it
eaiser to edit.

20090624-1:

Cleanup of dwc_in_bailiwick(), dwc_dname_same(), and dwc_decomp_offset()
to work with NULL (unused) "question" string.

New function: dwc_push_offsets()

20090623-1:

Set up some testing and fixed a couple of bugs in what exists with the 
DNS compression code.

20090622-1:

Makefile.comp added so I can start adding tests to test the compression
code.

20090619-1:

dwc_in_bailiwick() added to DNS compression code.

20090617-1:

dwc_dname_same() added to DNS compression code.

20090616-1:

Work on DNS compression code started

20090611-1:

Code cleanup: I have split up all functions over 52 lines in size down in
to pieces where each function is 52 lines or shorter.  This is required by
Deadwood's coding style document, and helps keep the code maintainable and 
manageable.

20090610-1:

dwc_decompress() now returns string in intended format (uncompressed string,
followed by, in left-to-right format, the offsets for all RRs and the 
beginning of TYPE for each RR, followed by AN/NS/AR counts, followed by
1-byte type).

20090608-2:

DNS RR decompression code works.  Now, add more length headers then
split out code so no single function is over 52 lines in length.

20090608-1:

DNS RR decompression appears to work, except for changing the RDlength of an
uncompressed label.

20090607-2:

More progress made with the decompression code; we now decompress all of
the packet except for compressed labels in the rddata part of a DNS RR.

20090607-1:

OK, starting a top-down approach of DwCompress.c; I have a main dwc_decompress
function which just needs parts filled in with the code I wrote yesterday.

2.3.04 (20090607):

Windows documentation updates: "ifconfig" replaced by "ipconfig"; since
I tested and verified Deadwood works in Windows 7 last night, docs updated
to mention Windows 7.

20090606-1:

Makefiles updated to compile DwCompress.c

Functions added (but not in any way tested) in DwCompress.c to decompress
a single "DNS name" label and to determine the format of an RR based on the
type number of the RR.

2.4.03 (20090603):

DwDict.c is now a simple wrapper for the updated routines in DwHash.c
with just a single function (dwd_nextkey) needing to be redone.

hash_magic_number test re-worked to pass again; since DwDict now uses
the part of the code which outputs debug info here, I needed to filter out
more stuff to get the test to pass again.

20090603-2:

sqa_valgrind test updated to ensure that Valgrind reports no errors when
Deadwood is compiled with -DVALGRIND_NOERRORS

dwh_hash_autogrow did not correctly go down linked list since
dwh_place_new changed point->next; fixed.

20090603-1:

DwHash.c routines pass Valgrind tests; new dwh_nuke_hash() function
added (which completely deallocates a hash and all of its elements).

20090602-2:

dwh_hash_autogrow() function created and test framework (Makefile.hsck)
added to test this function.

20090601-1:

After looking at various hacks to give Object-oriented capabilities
to C, I decided to not go that route and just add a "use_fila" flag
to the relevant functions in DwHash.c.  This is how I'm going
to expand the hash routines in DwHash.c to work with DwDict.c.

Now I just need to add an autogrow function.

2.4.02 (20090526):

sqa_tcp test modified to have longer timeouts to run on slow internet
connections.  All SQA tests run and pass in CentOS Linux.

20090526-1:

Fixed things so Deadwood.exe works in Windows again.  I had to make sure,
when tcp_listen was disabled, to not look at possible TCP sockets when 
deciding which socket number was the highest socket number to select()
with.

In Windows, it is now possible to run Deadwood as a non-service as
"Deadwood.exe --debug dwood2rc.txt".  This is so I can more easily 
debug Windows-specific problems.

20090525-2:

Better error message when an upstream_servers dictionary index doesn't
end in a dot, and a section added to the manual explaining that 
upstream_servers dictionary indexes *must* end in a dot.

20090525-1:

We now show the user which domain name has problems when telling
them upstream_servers has a bad value.

20090524-1:

Tests updated to reflect post-2.4.01 changes to Deadwood code.

num_retries value increased to 2, since we no longer round-robin
rotate the upstream server we use, but choose one at random.

20090522-1:

Documentation updated to reflect improvments to upstream_servers; 
upstream_servers SQA test updated.

2.3.03 (20090521): 

Backport of parser bug bugfix to 2.3 branch of Deadwood.

20090521-2:

Bugfix: Lines like upstream_servers = {} now correctly parse (we will
soon make these lines mandatory)

20090521-1:

upstream_servers now allows one to have different DNS servers handle 
subtrees of the DNS space.

20090519-1:

New dwood2rc parameter: tcp_listen.  If this is not set, Deadwood will not
perform DNS-over-TCP.  DNS-over-TCP is now disabled by default (in the
real world, things are perfectly OK without DNS-over-TCP, and it does
increase the area of exposure)

New DNS string manipulation functions revised to conform to Deadwood
coding styles (all memory writes accompanied by bounds checking)

Spell checking done for this changelog and DwMain man page.

20090518-1:

Some more improvements to the infrastructure for MaraRC dictionary variables
and string functions to handle DNS-style strings.

version.h now has correct version again

20090517-1:

Bugs in infrastructure for MaraRC dictionary variables fixed.  New files
added to source: DwDict.c and DwDict.h, which generalize the interface
for support for dictionary structures.  

20090514-1:

DwMararc.c overhaul; dictionary variables are now real dictionary
variables with a simple API in place to have other pieces of code
use dictionary variables in the dwood2rc configuration file.

20090512-1:

Code changed so get_upstream_ip knows the query it's getting an
upstream IP for (this makes it possible to change this code to
have the upstream IP vary, depending on the query we give it)

2.4.01 (20090510):

New SQA test to make sure TCP buffering works at all points (delays
in sending DNS-over-TCP packet, delays in getting DNS-over-TCP packet
upstream, and delays getting DNS-over-TCP sent back downstream)

New feature release: Revamp of DNS-over-TCP

Documentation updated

20090508-1:

New test added, sqa_tcp_buffering, that makes sure TCP buffering works for
getting data from upstream.

Code updated to have functional TCP buffering.

20090505-1:

Added new SQA tool, "truncated", which always returns, over UDP, a
"truncated" reply.

send_packet_stdin SQA tool should now be able to have pauses in the
TCP packet it sends.

20090504-1:

show_packet_stdout now has support for sending the DNS packets in parts,
so we can test TCP buffering.

20090503-1:

A couple of programs for testing DNS-over-TCP have been written and
can be seen in tools/sqa

20090430-1:

OK, at this point the code appears to be able to handle getting
big DNS packets from the upstream DNS provider and forwarding them
via TCP to the local DNS resolver; note that these big packets 
aren't cached.

20090429-1:

Some more work on handling DNS packets too big to fit in 512 bytes:
Test that uses named (BIND) to generate big DNS packet added 
(sqa_bigpacket); some more code to handle these big packets correctly
added.

20090428-2:

TCP query added to memory leak test; 3-byte memory leak found and plugged

"CODE HERE" comment added to DwUdpSocket.c where I will add code to send
a TCP query upstream if we're using a TCP client and got a truncated 
reply upstream.

20090428-1:

"maxprocs" test modified to fail at random less; I have verified that this
test has succeeded five times in a row.

New test added: dwood2rc_n_handle_noreply_tcp, which sees how Deadwood
handles DNS-over-TCP when the upstream server doesn't reply

20090427-2:

Server fail sent to TCP client if no upstream servers are reachable

If handle_noreply has a value of 0, TCP connection closed if no upstream
servers are available; Documentation updated to note this behavior

NOCACHE option removed; we'll keep this in Deadwood 2.3, which is the
Deadwood version to use on embedded systems.

SQA tests updated; maxprocs test disabled because it's too flaky (Todo:
make this test reliable and consistent)

Program compiles and runs in Windows

20090427-1:

TCP idle timeout works again

TCP DNS queries will use cached entries before trying to make a UDP
connection

All compile-time warnings removed

Marco Njezic pointed out Windows service won't run if there was a space
in a path to Deadwood.exe; fixed.

20090426-2:

Fairly major overhaul of DwTcpSocket.c and DwUdpSocket.c; the
Deadwood daemon, now, when it gets a DNS-over-TCP query, converts
the query in to a DNS-over-UDP query and sends it upstream, converting
the UDP reply in to a TCP reply to give the client.

This code is a bit rough; for example, this conversion doesn't use
the UDP cache, and there are some compile-time warnings, but things
work.

20090426-1: 

No-longer-used functions removed from DwTcpSocket.c

DwWinSvc.c reverted to version from Deadwood 2.2.01

DwWinSvc.c updated to show version number and usage when executed "raw";
and to show http://maradns.org/deadwood in the list of services

Windows documentation updated to reflect DNS and UDP being the
same service.

make.version.h updated to handle deadwood-Q-YYYYMMDD-N form of snapshots

20090425:

DwMain now listens on both UDP and TCP, forwarding TCP connections upstream
and caching/answering UDP connections.

Two new parameters: max_tcp_procs and timeout_seconds_tcp

When run as DwTcp, DwMain now exits with a "DwMain now supports TCP" message

Documentation and SQA tests updated to reflect DwMain now handling 
DNS-over-TCP.

2.3.02 (20090424):

Documentation updated; out-of-date references removed and manpage now
lists default values for all numeric parameters.  Note added to Windows
README.txt that familiarity with cmd is needed.

Source code comment added to point out default values aren't always in
DwMararc.c

Minor revisions to the SQA tests and documentation.

2.3.01 (20090422):

Compiled and tested in CentOS 5 64-bit (works without problem)

Windows build now shows version number, both when run without arguments or
when the service is installed, and in the logs when run as a service.

Some document updates.

20090421:

Windows documentation made part of the Deadwood source tree.

Documentation spell-checked and more CentOS-isms removed from Windows
Manual.txt file.

New compile-time flag: -DNOCACHE which disables Deadwood caching

Compile-time flags documented in doc/compile.options

SQA tests added for -DNOCACHE, -DNOCACHE -DIPV6, and to ensure the
program has no errors when compiled with gcc43.

All SQA tests run and work.

2.2.02 (20090420):

TCP messages now logged to dwtcplog.txt

In service name in list of Windows services, http://maradns.org/deadwood/
URL is in list.

sqa_tcp test moved to be first test done (since this test is the one
which we will need to change most often)

20090419:

Marko Njezic has added code so the Windows service has both UDP and TCP
support; I would like to thank Mr. Njezic for his contributions.

2.1.02 (20090416):

TCP fix backported to 2.1 branch of Deadwood.

20090415:

Mr. Max pointed out that TCP didn't work; fixed.  Now I need to release
a Deadwood 2.1.02 with this fix backported (the patch,
included here, applies cleanly to both versions of Deadwood)

Real-world TCP regression test added, so this problem doesn't bite us
again.

20090413:

Vista.txt file added to documentation that describes how to run
Deadwood in Windows Vista (Yes, I know, the real solution is to set
up a UAC manifest, but I only downloaded the tools to do that today
and don't have a Vista machine to test things on any more)

2.2.01 (20090407):

DwWinSvc.c fixed so it's possible to uninstall the Deadwood service.

INSTALL.txt clarified to point out that Deadwood is a DNS cache.

First testing release of Deadwood with Windows service code, including a 
Win32 binary.

do.tests in sqa/ directory updated to work with new Deadwood build
process (make -f Makefile.centos5).  Also, CC is set to gcc

All mentions of MicroDNS removed (thanks Mr. Max for the heads-up)

20090406:

All compile-time warnings in Win32 removed.

Code to install and remove service now lets user know if the service was
installed or removed.

Win32 README added (this is mostly a copy-and-paste of INSTALL.txt)

20090403:

log file name changed from "log.txt" to "dwlog.txt" (so admins who forgot
where they put Deadwood can more easily find dwlog.txt)

Date and time added to Windows dwlog.txt logfile

log file flushed whenever there is a second of inactivity (if the server
is busy, the log file won't get flushed, but will get flushed when idle)

Note about "dwlog.txt"'s existence added to INSTALL file.

INSTALL file changed to use Win32 line breaks and renamed "INSTALL.txt";
file updated to have more comprehensive startup information for CentOS 5
and a note about dwlog.txt.

Fatal dwood2rc error now correctly noted as a dwood2rc error

Makefile renamed Makefile.centos5 in src/; Makefile.mingw renamed
Makefile.mingw310 (I'm making it clear I only support CentOS 5 and
MinGW 3.1.0)

Cleanup of Makefile for duende helper

20090401:

Some cleaning up of log code (logs are cleaner, append to logfile)

Some compile-time warnings in Win32 removed

20090330:

Progress made having proper logging when running as a Windows service

20090328:

Some cleanup of the service code; the service now can be properly stopped
and will write the cache to a file when the service is being stopped;
log.txt is no longer written.

Makefile.sun removed; the only supported platforms for Deadwood are as
a native Windows service and as a UNIX daemon in CentOS 5.

dwood2rc.mingw revised; we can now read and write to cache in Windows (woot!)

20090327:

First working Windows service of Deadwood (woot!).

Look in the DwWinSvc.c file on how to start and stop the service; note
that the service currently can't be stopped without going to the task manager
and killing the Deadwood.exe process.  Note also it writes a log.txt in the
directory with Deadwood.exe containing debugging info.

I hope to clean some of this up this weekend.

20090325:

DwWinSvc.c file added; this is the infrastructure that will be used to 
make Deadwood a Windows service.

20090318: 

DwMain and DwTcp are now a single combined binary; this cuts in half 
the code size when one wants both DNS-over-UDP and DNS-over-TCP supported.

DwMain man page updated to discuss DwMain security.

20090317:

New SQA test added: "Roy Arends" check to make sure Deadwood ignores
DNS answers.

20090310:

Valgrind errors found and resolved: Valgrind doesn't like how I read
uninitialized data as one entropy source, so now there is an 
optional compile-time flag (-DVALGRIND_NOERRORS) that allows the
program to be run in Valgrind without getting nasty errors about
using uninitialized data.  This removes all Valgrind run-time errors.

2.1.01 (20090309):

Memory leaks found by Valgrind plugged

Test added to use Valgrind to ensure Deadwood does not leak memory

20090307:

--All tests are done and 2.1.01 will be released Monday after a couple
  of days of real-world testing--

resurrections test updated to verify behavior changes when resurrections is
off compared to being on.

hash_magic_number modified again to test in a consistent and automated manner

basic_ipv6_test slightly revised and now run as part of do.tests

SQA test for handling the case of one upstream DNS server being down; 
yes Deadwood will still happily process queries (albeit more slowly)

SQA test for making sure the name and the ID agree added; passed

SQA test to make sure CNAME chains work and we use the lowest TTL; passed

dwood2rc parser documentation updated since the parser can actually have
up to 51 states.

20090306:

Mini-DNS-server for num_retires now makes sure the DNS question one sends
us is indeed a question (the "Roy Arends" check).

vim screwed up DwSys.c, putting tabs at the beginning of a lot of lines
of code; fixed.

resurrections test added; all non-ipv6 parameters now have tests

20090305:

SQA meta-test revamped to compile MaraDNS and Deadwood before running 
the tests (this makes tests that need custom compiles, such as the
hash_magic_number and IPV6 tests, possible).  dwood2rc_n_hash_magic_number
now tested during meta-test run.

Meta-test fixed so we no longer have to do a 2> /dev/null to have a
clean test output.

Revision to dwood2rc_n_hash_magic_number so test can consistently succeed

num_retries test added (complete with mini-udp-server for the test)

20090304:

Test added for hash_magic_number (needs custom compile of Deadwood to run,
though)

Test added for recurse_min_bind_port and recurse_number_ports

DwMain.txt and DwTcp.txt files munged; fixed.

20090303:

Bugfix: The hash only used the first four bytes of a hash key and the key's
length to determine where to put a hash in memory.  Fixed (This will
be more thoroughly tested when testing hash_magic_number)

maximum_cache_elements test now works (yesterday's issue was caused
because one of the two upstream DNS servers in the test was non-responsive,
and the timeout was not long enough to have deadwood try the other server)

DwTcp now has a man page

20090302:

Work has begun on maximum_cache_elements test; it looks like there are
issues with caching which I need to look at.

20090228:

verbose_level now visible when 4 or greater (to make verbose_level
test possible)

verbose_level test added

20090227:

Tests added: upstream_servers and upstream_port

20090226:

BUGS section removed from DwMain man page (the "Google problem" has now
been fixed)

Tests added for maradns_gid and maradns_uid parameters

20090225:

DwMain man page updated to fully document handle_noreply parameter

bind_address test fixed

Tests added for cache_file, chroot_dir, handle_noreply, and 
ipv4_bind_addresses

20090224:

bind_address test added.

20090223:

All Deadwood 1 SQA tests updated to work with Deadwood 2 and pass.

20090222:

Beginning work on revamping sqa test suite for Deadwood 2 (this hasn't been
touched since Deadwood 1); basic_test and basic_tcp_test work.

2.04 (20090220): 

Simple patch to remove all warnings when compiled in Ubuntu 8.10.

Released declared relatively stable.

20090218:

DwTcp now has basic TCP buffering and works.

20090216: 

DwTcp default mararc file location changed to /etc/dwood2rc

Work has begun on buffering TCP connections

20090127:

A simple one-line change: We no longer show the version number twice
when invoked as "deadwood --version" or "deadwood -v" or as 
"deadwood --help"

20090126:

Logging revamped; raw printf statements mostly removed and verbose_level
support added.  

20090124:

Bugfix: Cache size is now determined from one's dwood2rc preferences, not
        from the file storing the cache.

20090123a:

Bugfix: Negative answers now correctly cached (bug introduced in 20090123)

20090123:

All for(;;) potential infinite loops changed in to loops that increment
a counter and stop after a while; this is to stop potential freeze-ups.

It's now possible to resolve DNS answers with nothing but CNAMEs.

20090122:
Bugfix: Preliminary version of "Google fix" implemented.  Currently, it
        has a bug: It doesn't allow DNS packets with nothing but CNAME
        records to be cached (or returned to the DNS client).  

2.03 (20090109):

Bugfix: We no longer exit with a misleading fatal error if we fail to bind
to one of multiple IPs.

20090108:

Source code to DwMain and DwTcp put in its own directory; INSTALL
document added.

20090103:

Man page for DwMain revised: Sorted dwood2rc parameters; added section on
bugs and on ip/mask format.  Added Makefile in doc/ directory.

20081230:

Man page for DwMain added.  Duende and "ej" tools (from MaraDNS) added.

2.02 (20080828):

OK, it's been a week and 20080821 looks stable.  I'm making this the 
next stable release of Deadwood.

20080821: 

Untested, but I have changed the code to make sure both the name and
the ID agree for incoming DNS queries.

20080818:

Resurrections now work when it's impossible to send a packet upstream.

Warning when compiling in Cygwin removed (casting fixed it).

Program now shows version number at startup.

20080812:

Two minor patches by Neeo; one that speeds things up a little bit,
and another that makes sure 0-TTL entries are not cached.

20080806:

This fixes the problem with empty or malformed DNS packets by having these 
empty packets detected before they're added to the cache, and having 
it so said packets are never forwarded.

20080721:

Bugfix: Sometimes the resolver would have an empty packet in the
cache.  This release works around the bug by having it so cached
empty packets are not accepted, and discarded from the cache.

This still doesn't address the issue of why these empty packets got
in the cache in the first place.

Now a keyboard interrupt (read: Stopping DwMain with control-C) will
make it so the cache is written to a file.

20080615:

Bugfix (possible security implications): We change to the chroot() 
directory before doing the chroot() call, to make sure we're in a 
restricted sandbox, and to make sure the chroot parameter can affect
where the cache is stored.

We now also inform the user when the cache can not be read or written,
so they can address the issue.

Bugfix: Deadwood 2 now compiles in MinGW (it now makes a native Windows
binary that doesn't need Cygwin) again.

20071217:

The code now sends a server fail if it was unable to contact any upstream
servers (this is a user-settable parameter); the code now also looks for an
expired record in the cache before sending a server fail, again 
user-settable.

Also, the code will try sending a packet to the upstream server again before
looking for an expired record or sending a server fail (this code is a bit
of a hack), also user-settable.

20071210:

Reading and writing the cache to disk is now supported.  Three new
dwood2rc parameters: cache_file, maradns_uid, and maradns_gid.  All
dwood2rc parameters now have basic documentation in README.

20071207:

Basic caching supported.

20071125: 

DwHash really completed.  A bug found and fixed; it now has the ability
to write the hash to a file and read the hash from that file.  Some
debug-only "HSCK" code added that makes sure there isn't memory corruption
in the hash.

20071118:

DwHash completed (except for expire check); we can now get elements
from the hash, put elements in the hash.  The hash automatically
zaps elements not recently accessed when it fills up.  Tested and
looks bulletproof.

20071107: 

I have added four mararc (OK, dwood2rc) numeric parameters:

	recurse_min_bind_port The lowest port Deadwood will bind to
                              for an upstream DNS query
	recurse_number_ports Number of ports Deadwood will use for
                             the random source port in an upstream
                             DNS query
	hash_magic_number This can be a 31-bit prime, that is be used
                          in the hash compression function
        maximum_cache_elements Maximum number of elements we allow 
                               the cache to have

I have also fleshed out the design of the hash a little more, and have
added code to read mararc (OK, dwood2rc) parameters in DwHash.c

20071106: 

Initial version of Deadwood-2.  Quick and dirty hash compression designed
and implemented.  It's not completely safe, but it's very fast, and should
be safe if correctly used (in other words, if the user selects a good
large random 31-bit prime number, they should be safe).

The hash compressor is described in HASH.DESIGN.
