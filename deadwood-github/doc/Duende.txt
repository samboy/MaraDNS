                                 NAME

   duende - run a child process as a daemon

                             DESCRIPTION

   duende makes a given child process a daemon. The standard output
   and standard error of the child process is logged via syslog()
   with a priority of LOG_INFO (LOG_ALERT on FreeBSD systems).

                                USAGE

   duende (--pid=/path/to/file) child_process [ all subsequent
   arguments passed on to child ]

                               DETAILS

   When duende is invoked, it spawns two processes. In addition to
   spawning the daemonized child process, duende also spawns a
   process which reads and logs the standard output of the
   daemonized process. The parent process stays alive so as to
   monitor the daemonized process. If the optional --pid argument
   is supplied, duende will write it's PID to the file specified by
   the argument. It is an error to supply the --pid argument
   without an equal sign and file name.

   duende requires a blank directory named /etc/maradns/logger to
   run.

   Should the parent duende process a HUP signal, duende will
   restart the child process. Should the daemonized or logging
   process received an untrapped HUP signal or exit with an exit
   code of 8, duende will restart the process. Should the
   daemonized or logging process exit for any other reason, duende
   will send the logger process a TERM signal and exit. Should the
   duende parent process receive a TERM or INT signal, duende sends
   all of its children TERM signals, then exits.

   The duende process must be started as the superuser; this is
   because Duende's intended child processes (maradns, DwMain, and
   DwTcp) need to bind to privileged ports, and because duende uses
   a setuid() call to change the user ID of the logging process to
   the user with ID 66.

                               LOGGING

   duende uses the syslog() facility to log the standard output of
   the program that it invokes. The name of the program (in other
   words, the "ident" given to openlog()) is the full path of the
   first argument given to duende. All messages created by the
   child process are sent to syslog() with a priority of LOG_INFO
   (LOG_ALERT on FreeBSD systems) and a "facility" of LOG_DAEMON;
   should duende itself encounter an error, it will send messages
   to syslog() with a priority of LOG_ALERT.

   For example, suppose one invokes duende thusly:

         duende /usr/local/sbin/DwMain

   If invoked thusly, duende will log all messages with the "ident"
   (program name) of "/usr/local/sbin/DwMain". If this is not
   desired, invoke duende with something like:

         export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin
         duende DwMain

   This will log messages with a (more sensible) "ident" of DwMain.

   Note: If a non-POSIX Bourne shell (such as csh, es, rc, or fish)
   is used to invoke DwMain, the above syntax needs to be changed.

   Also, the directory /etc/maradns/logger, while used by duende,
   is not used to store any log messages. That is unless, for some
   reason, one configures syslog to store messages there.

                               EXAMPLES

   Using duende to start DwMain, where the configuration file is
   /etc/dwood3rc.2

         duende DwMain -f /etc/dwood3rc.2

   Using duende to start zoneserver, where the mararc file is
   /etc/mararc.4

         duende zoneserver -f /etc/mararc.4

                                 BUGS

   Duende assumes that all of its children are well-behaved, eating
   their vegetables, going to bed when told, and terminating when
   receiving a TERM signal.
