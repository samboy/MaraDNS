     * Bugfix: MaraDNS should now be able to compile on Mac OS X
       (Darwin) again.
     * Some SQA test fixes: The private_ips test should now work

       increased in order to minimize the chances of the program
       dying because it can not allocate memory.

       write the cache to a file.
     * Fixed bug where MaraDNS did not correctly echo the rd bit
       the client sent us.
     * The RA bit in the header is cleared when sending an
       authoritative answer, and set when sending a recursive
       answer. Thanks to Jan Hrdonka for the bug report.
     * Allow there to be CSV2 zone files with nothing but SOA
       and NS records. Again, thanks to Jan Hrdonka for the bug
       report.

       is a work in progress that will (hopefully) become a full
       fledged thread-free recursive DNS server. Right now, it's
       only a basic UDP-only DNS load balancer.
     * .rpm files are no longer part of MaraDNS releases. People
       who wish to have a .rpm can use the .spec file in build/
       to make their own .rpm files.
     * A script now automatically updates the .spec file
     * Mr. Sarton has added some ipv6 support to askmara-tcp and
       askmara. Note that MaraDNS needs to be compiled with

     * askmara updated to correctly escape hash ('#') characters
       in TXT records
     * It's now possible again, when debug_msg_level has a
       sufficiently high level, to remotely see MaraDNS'
       timestamp when MaraDNS is only doing recursion.
     * The mararc parameter dns_port now works.
     * AIX support contributed by Alfred Reibenschuh

       "noat" parse bug, Star handling when bind_star_handling
       has a value of 1, improper RR rotation bug, and making
       sure the example mararc file in the zoneserver man page
       is correct

     (2007.08.29)

   maradns-1.2.12.07:
   This is a stable bugfix-only release of MaraDNS. All of these
   bug fixes are backports of bugs fixed in the 1.3 branch.

     * Bugfix: If bind_star_handling was set to 2, MaraDNS would
       leak memory when the existance of another RR stopped
       resolution using a star record.
     * Bugfix: bind_star_handling, when set to 2, now appears to
       do the right thing.
     * Bugfix: Non-critical double-free() removed.
     * Bugfix: askmara no longer goes in to an infinite loop
       when it receives an invalid TXT record.

       longer than 255 characters in all cases.

     (2007.08.16)

   maradns-1.3.07.03:
   This is a beta testing release of MaraDNS.

     * Bugfix: It is now possible to have a
       csv2_default_zonefile without any other zonefiles (This
       was a 1.3-only bug)
     * Bugfix: recurse_delegation now correctly works (1.3-only
       bug)
     * Cleanup: Documentation files with DOS-style newlines
       converted to have UNIX-style newlines
     * Script to update MaraDNS can now be run from a
       POSIX-compliant /bin/sh, and no longer uses bash-specific
       syntax
     * RFC2181 compliant truncation regression finished
     * SQA tests added: ANY and case insensitivity, LOC records,
       bind_star_handling set to 2, csv2_default_zonefile, NS
       delegation tests

     (2007.08.16)

   maradns-1.3.07.02:
   This is a beta testing release of MaraDNS.

     * Bugfix: askmara no longer goes in to an infinite loop

   This is a beta testing release of MaraDNS.

     * Documentation for the bind2csv2.py utility the converts
       zone files from BIND to MaraDNS format added.

     (2007.06.21)

   maradns-1.3.06:
   This is a testing release of MaraDNS.

     * Bugfix: If bind_star_handling was set to 2, MaraDNS would
       leak memory when the existance of another RR stopped
       resolution using a star record.
     * Bugfix: bind_star_handling, when set to 2, now appears to
       do the right thing.
     * Testing: Unit tests for the five memory leaks that have
       appeared in the 1.2/1.3 branches of MaraDNS.
     * Bugfix: The default max_mem is now a lot bigger when we
       need threads to perform recursion.

     (2007.06.19)

   maradns-1.3.05:
   This is a testing release of MaraDNS.

     * New mararc variable, max_mem added, that limits the
       amount of memory MaraDNS will allocate.
     * Bugfix: Whether to give a NXDOMAIN or a "not there" reply
       with star records fixed to be RFC1034 and RFC4074
       compliant.
     * Bugfix: Reply for hosts not in a csv2_default_zonefile
       now correctly return a "not there" instead of a NXDOMAIN
       (unless there is no host of any RR type that matches the
       desired name).
     * Bugfix: João Antunes Predator tool found two memory
       leaks. Fixed.

     (2007.05.21)

   maradns-1.2.12.06:
   This is a stable release of MaraDNS.

     * Bugfix: Whether to give a NXDOMAIN or a "not there" reply
       with star records fixed to be RFC1034 and RFC4074
       compliant.
     * Bugfix: Reply for hosts not in a csv2_default_zonefile
       now correctly return a "not there" instead of a NXDOMAIN
       (unless there is no host of any RR type that matches the
       desired name).
     * Bugfix: João Antunes Predator tool found two memory
       leaks. Fixed.

     (2007.05.17)

   maradns-1.3.04:

   This is a testing release of MaraDNS.

     * Remco pointed out that MaraDNS is not RFC4074 section 4.2
       compliant. Fixed.
     * Update of recursive server to make it more robust against
       certain DOS attacks.
     * The port range that the recursive resolver binds to can
       now be changed in the mararc file
     * FAQ and SQA updates

     (2007.03.22)

   maradns-1.0.40:

   This is a legacy release of MaraDNS

     * Backport of patch to make recursive server more robust
       against certain DOS attacks.

     (2007.03.05)

   maradns-1.2.12.05:

   This is a stable release of MaraDNS

     * LOC records with a precision that is a multiple of 10 now
       work.
     * Memory leak found by Rani Assaf plugged.
     * Recursive server now more robust against certain DOS
       attacks.
     * Documentation updates.

     (2007.02.17)

   maradns-1.3.03:

   This is a testing release of MaraDNS.

     * Memory leak found by Rani Assaf plugged; SQA suite now
       has regression that will find this leak.
     * Whether to recurse when MaraDNS would otherwise give out
       a NS delegation record is now a user-settable feature.
     * Bugfix: '.' can now be a hostname by itself.
     * Bugfix: MaraDNS now compiles with gcc 2.96 again.
     * The version.maradns special query now works in a 100%
       recursive server again (as long as admin_acl is set and
       gives permissions).
     * When the tilde is used to separate records, it is no
       longer necessary to have some of the WKS or LOC fields be
       on the same line.
     * When the tilde is used to separate records, it is no
       longer possible to have a pipe (|), hash (#), or
       nonprintable control character in a TXT record. This will
       make parsing of csv2 files by scripts easier.
     * When the tilde is used to separate records, multiple TXT
       chunks can now be separated by whitespace. This allows
       for foo.% TXT 'chunk 1' 'chunk 2' records.
     * Documentation updates.

     (2007.02.14)

   maradns-1.3.02:

   This is a testing release of MaraDNS.

     * The recursive resolver can now use custom root servers
       for subtrees of the DNS space; for example
       root_servers["local."] = "10.1.2.3"
     * Windows port now compiles with -Os, resulting in a
       smaller Windows binary (actually, when I built the
       1.2.12.04 binary, I set this parameter by hand; now it's
       the default Windows build flag)
     * Windows port now uses pthreads-w32 2.8 instead of
       pthreads-w32 2.6
     * csv2 parsing code updated to always allow and always
       ignore commented tildes
     * Bugfix: Star records that aren't in an authoritative zone
       now work
     * MaraDNS now will not waste time trying to find
       authoritative records if there are no authoritative
       records to find
     * Some minor webpage updates
     * Troubleshooting guide added to tutorial

     (2007.01.09)

   maradns-1.3.01:

   This is a testing release of MaraDNS.

     * csv2 zone files now can use tildes to separate resource
       records.
     * New mararc variables: upstream_port and bind_port
     * zoneserver now kills its child processes when getting a
       TERM signal.
     * zoneserver now tells people the IP of failed zone
       transfer attempts when verbose_level is 4 or higher.

     (2006.12.21)

   maradns-1.2.12.04:

   This is a stable release of MaraDNS.

     * Bugfix: make debug works again. Note that make debug
       really slows MaraDNS down.
     * ej2man now works with both Perl 5.8.0 and 5.8.8. I would
       like to thank the people on comp.lang.perl.misc for their
       help.
     * ej2txt now works with different versions of links.
     * Fixed bug with ANY and case sensitivity. I would like to
       thank Kyler Laird for pointing out this issue.
     * Added new mararc variable, csv2_tilde_handling that
       currently does nothing but require, if set, having the
       value of 0. This is here so a MaraDNS 1.2.12 mararc is
       compatible with some future plans I have.
     * Added new compiler define UPSTREAM_PORT in MaraDns.h that
       allows the port MaraDNS uses to connect to other
       nameservers to be more easily changed.

     (2006.11.24)

   maradns-1.2.12.03:

   This is a stable release of MaraDNS.

     * Bugfix: MaraDNS no longer sends out incorrect "server
       fail" DNS messages. This should make MaraDNS a better
       resolver.
     * Bugfix: Spurious "Bad query received" messages.
     * Some minor updates to the documentation
     * Incomplete bind2csv2.py script added; this is a work in
       progress.
     * Advocacy document is now a part of the MaraDNS.org
       webpage.
     * Updates to Daniel Zilli's maraconf script.

     (2006.10.08)

   maradns-1.2.12.02:

   This is a stable release of MaraDNS.

     * Slight cleanup to new Csv2 parsing code
     * Bugfix: A PTR that pointed to a CNAME that pointed to a
       non-responsive server would create a slightly invalid DNS
       packet. Fixed.
     * Bugfix: RFC2181-compliant truncation was broken. Fixed.
     * Updates to the old pre-1.0 testbed to run this testbed
       again (MaraDNS passed with flying colors)
     * Updates to the 1.2 testbed
     * Updates to the stress test that sends a large number of
       real DNS queries
     * FAQ entry about how to debug NS delegation problems added
     * Updates to FAQ and documentation.
     * Minor update to compression code to make it conform to
       MaraDNS coding style.
     * Documents advocating MaraDNS added (this is a work in
       progress)
     * mqhash utility documented.
     * Various non-critical memory leaks (memory allocated once
       during startup which wasn't correctly freed) and one
       minor error (which was not a security problem) were
       detected by Valgrind and fixed.
     * .pdf man page reference now uses letter size paper again.

     (2006.08.14)

   maradns-1.2.12.01:

   This is a testing release of MaraDNS.

     * Memory leak plugged: MaraDNS' resolver was leaking about
       300 bytes whenever someone asked for a PTR that pointed
       to a CNAME that didn't point to a legitimate PTR.
     * Vlatko Kosturjak from Croatia has added chkconfig support
       to the RPM spec file.
     * Documentation on making MaraDNS a Win32 service added.
     * Truncation of records too long to fit in a 512-byte
       packet now done in a RFC2181-compliant manner.
     * Slash commands added to csv2 zone files: '/serial', which
       allows the serial for a zone file to be automatically
       updated whenever the zone file is edited; '/ttl', which
       allows the default TTL to be changed; '/origin', which
       allows the origin to be changed; '/opush' and '/opop'
       which allow the origin's values to be put on a stack; and
       '/read', which allows another file to be included in a
       zonefile.
     * Some tidying of the Csv2 parsing code to deallocate
       unneeded memory resources; this should lower MaraDNS
       memory usage when a large number of csv2 zone files
       exist.
     * Records stored in the authoritative half are now always
       marked "authoritative" in the DNS header; records not in
       a zone will simply not have NS records in the NS/AR
       section of the answer.
     * Download page revamped to be faster and easier to use.

     (2006.07.26)

   maradns-1.0.39:

     (2006.07.24)

   maradns-1.2.07.8:

     * Backport of adding infomation about dangling CNAMEs to
       FAQ from testing branch (see Debian bug #373781)
     * Backport of explicit exit 0 added to MaraDNS start/stop
       script (Debian bug #374655)
     * Backport of 1.2.11 bugfix: We can now have email
       addresses without @ (using . instead)
     * Memory leak plugged: MaraDNS' resolver was leaking about
       300 bytes whenever someone asked for a PTR that pointed
       to a CNAME that didn't point to a legitimate PTR.
     * Vlatko Kosturjak from Croatia has added chkconfig support
       to the RPM spec file.

     (2006.07.24)

   maradns-1.2.11:

     * All known RR types added to MaraDns.h
     * Support for the following RR types added to CSV2 zone
       files: HINFO, WKS, MD, MF, MB, MG, MINFO, MR, AFSDB, RP,
       X25, ISDN, RT, NSAP, NSAP-PTR, PX, GPOS, and LOC.
     * Bugfix: We can now have email addresses without @ (using
       . instead)

     (2006.07.18)

   maradns-1.2.07.7:

     * Backport of patch to work around Perl á annoyances to the
       stable branch.

     (2006.07.12)

   maradns-1.2.10:

     * Issues with á in man pages finally fixed; Perl is such a
       pain sometimes
     * More timestamp types added as per Remmy's patch
     * Information about dangling CNAME entries added to FAQ
       (see Debian bug #373781)
     * Explicit exit 0 added to MaraDNS start/stop script (see
       Debian bug #374655)

     (2006.06.21)

     * Backport of MaraDNS 1.2.09 Microsoft.com fix to stable
       branch
     * Backport of MaraDNS 1.2.08 ej2man fix to stable branch

     (2006.06.16)

   maradns-1.0.38:

     Backport of MaraDNS 1.2.09 Microsoft.com fix to legacy 1.0
     branch

     (2006.06.16)

   maradns-1.2.09:

     * Recursive resolver patched to be able to process the
       bizarre packets that Microsoft.com's DNS server makes.
     * Some minor documentation cleanup.

     (2006.06.14)

   maradns-1.2.08:

     * Added support for RFC4408 SPF record type
     * Added new mararc variable retry_cycles. This allows us to
       contact all of the DNS servers to resolve a name before
       giving up.
     * Updated ej2man to not put a literal á in man page nroff
       sources (Debian's lint doesn't like this).
     * Askmara updated to inform user of error from remote DNS
       server.

     (2006.06.11)

   maradns-1.2.07.5:

     * pdf file problems should be fixed

     (2006.05.29)

   maradns-1.2.07.4:

     * Delegation NS records fixed
     * Some minor mararc parsing bugs fixed
     * Documentation tweaks (the webpage now validates, etc.)

     (2006.05.23)

   maradns-1.2.07.3:

     * MaraDNS compiles on OpenBSD (Thanks, Adam Montague, for
       the OpenBSD account).
     * MaraDNS RPM file fixed to include /etc/maradns/logger
       directory that the daeminizing tool needs.
     * Documentation updated to clarify that a single name can
       have more than one IP
     * Updated the mqhash password management utility (Next:
       Document this useful little program).
     * The binary RPM is now built on CentOS 3.7 instead of
       RedHat 6.2

     (2006.05.15)

   maradns-1.0.37:

     This is an update for the 1.0 legacy branch of MaraDNS
     * Removed all example mararc files which allow any IP on
       the internet to perform recursive queries (these can be
       used for denial of service attacks)

     (2006.04.07)

   maradns-1.2.03.6:

     Unless there is demand from MaraDNS' users, this will be
     the last release for the legacy 1.2.03 branch of MaraDNS.
     * Backport of zoneserver startup fix from the 1.2.07
       branch.

     (2006.04.07)

   maradns-1.2.07.2:

     * Location of Duende in the zoneserver startup script was
       broken. Fixed. Thanks to Daniel Zilli for finding this.
     * Have the server return "server fail" instead of "format
       error" when no nameservers can be contacted when trying
       to resolve a given host name.
     * Make the default behavior for the above case be to send
       out that "server fail" message.
     * Added Danial Zilli's wonderful Brazilian Portuguese
       translation of Mara's documents and status messages.

     (2006.04.05)

   maradns-1.2.07.1:

     * duende now always logs a message before exiting
     * zone names are now case-insensitive.
     * Programs in sqa/ directory can compile again.
     * Dictionary variables now must be initialized to work.
     * Documentation updated.

     (2006.03.22)

   maradns-1.2.03.5:

     * duende tool always logs something before exiting
     * "Using default ICANN servers" message now has newline
     * Broken upstream_servers example in docs fixed

     (2006.03.21)

   maradns-1.2.06: This is a testing (possibly unstable) release
   of MaraDNS.

     * Many minor updates to the documentation.
     * Web page HTML/CSS updated to look better in MSIE 6.
     * New mararc variable, handle_noreply, which determines how
       to inform the DNS client that no remote servers could be
       contacted when trying to resolve a host name.
     * It is now possible to send DNS error messages via the
       udperror() function again.
     * Some minor update to how log messages are output.

     (2006.03.10)

   maradns-1.2.03.4:

     * It is now possible to send DNS error messages via the
       udperror() function again.

     (2006.03.03)

   maradns-1.2.05:

   This is a testing (possibly unstable) release of MaraDNS.

     * Added faq entry about setting upstream_servers
     * Removed three unimplemented (or never documented and
       disabled) mararc variables: tuzona_inetd, win9x_service,
       and resurrections.
     * Out-of-bailiwick authoritative records now no longer have
       an authority section.
     * New csv2 record type "FQDN4"; this is an A record which
       automatically makes the corresponding PTR record.
     * CNAME records now mentioned in csv2 man page.
     * Improved error message for a hostname that doesn't end in
       a '.' (or '%').
     * Added admin_acl mararc variable, to limit the IPs that
       can see MaraDNS' version number (and debug information
       about MaraDNS' internal state when debug_msg_level is
       set).
     * Added remote_admin mararc variable, which allows IPs
       listed in admin_acl to remotely change the amount of
       information logged by MaraDNS. This is mainly for
       debugging problems on high-traffic sites where a full log
       is too large (and slows things down too much) to be
       practical.

     (2006.02.21)

   maradns-1.2.03.3:

     * MaraDNS 1.2.04 Cygwin fix patch applied to the stable
       branch
     * FAQ updated to tell people how to use upstream_servers

     (2006.02.10)

   maradns-1.2.04:

   This is a testing (potentially unstable) release of MaraDNS.

     * Cygwin fix: chroot() and setuid() do not effectively work
       on Cygwin; MaraDNS updated to not use these calls in
       Cygwin. This makes the Cygwin release not have all of the
       security of a native UNIX version of MaraDNS.
     * RPM updates: Spec file made current; mararc for RPM
       updated for MaraDNS 1.2; RPM updated by Greg Swallow to
       compile on CentOS 3 and 4.
     * Updates to the recursive code to make MaraDNS run better
       when used by a large ISP:
         1. TTL determining code updated
         2. Two minor typos fixed
         3. Custodian tweaked to work better under high load
         4. maxprocs can now be as high as 5000
         5. min_visible_ttl mararc variable added

     (2006.02.09)

   maradns-1.2.03.2:

     * Hotfix: Re-apply fix for broken Linux 2.6 kernel behavior
       which causes MaraDNS to freeze.
     * Mingw32: Have the binaries stripped

     (2006.02.02)

   maradns-1.2.03.1:

     * Fixed issue with ANY queries pointed out by Christian
       Klossek.
     * Made bind_star_handling even more RFC-compliant: If
       *.example.com. and bar.example.com. exist, then
       foo.bar.example.com. should point to "not there" instead
       of whatever *.example.com points at.
     * Updated mingw32 port: Removed compile-time warnings, set
       up scripts to mostly automate making the .zip file for
       the win32 MaraDNS binary.
     * Updated numbering scheme to use
       major.minor.revision.patchlevel for stable 1.2 releases;
       this allows the 1.2 branch to better have both a testing
       and a stable branch.

     (2006.01.21)

   maradns-1.2.02: This is a beta-test potentially unstable
   release, since the changes are significant enough to warrant
   full testing before declaring this as stable as previous 1.2
   releases of MaraDNS.

     * Changed build process to have consistent compile-time
       flags in all directories, and to allow people on
       unsupported platforms to compile MaraDNS after they look
       at obnoxious error message.
     * Fixed all of the compile-time warnings this change
       brought out.
     * Added a new mararc variable, bind_star_handling for
       people who want full BIND compatibility with star
       records.
     * Documentation updates: bind_star_handling documented,
       SOURCE.FILES made current.
     * Copyright notice updated for 2006
     * .gz tarball now optimized by Igor Pavlov and Andrea
       Mazzoleni's advdef program; this reduces size of .gz
       tarball by about 5%

     (2006.01.02)

   maradns-1.2.01:

     * Added script that will (mostly) automatically explode the
       tarball of the last release of MaraDNS, apply the
       patches, update the doc, and make the patches part of the
       1.2 release.
     * Updated dangling CNAME document to clarify that typos can
       also cause the dangling CNAME warning.
     * Updated the tarball building process of MaraDNS to also
       use Igor Pavlov's LZMA compression to make a compressed
       MaraDNS tarball which is both smaller and extracts faster
       than the bzip2 tarball.
     * Fixed spurious dangling CNAME warning bug which Alex
       Kapranoff found.

     (2006.01.01)

   maradns-1.0.36:

     This is a bugfix release for the legacy 1.0 branch of
     MaraDNS.
     * A backport of the 2-line patch recently posted to the
       mailing list concerning incorrect dangling CNAME warnings

     (2005.12.31)

   maradns-1.2.00:

     This is the new stable release of MaraDNS, which is an
     update of the 1.0 branch. The 1.0 branch will be
     maintained for standard bugfixes until December 21, 2007;
     critical security fixes, should they occur, will be
     applied to the 1.0 branch until December 21, 2010.

     Here are the changes from 1.1.91:
     * A small change to dns/Decompress.c so that MaraDNS runs
       on the compiler that comes with the IBM Power version of
       SuSE.
     * Minor corrections to the FAQ
     * BINDFAIL message no longer says that there's probably
       another process using port 53; there are a number of
       things that can trigger this error message and the
       "System said" message usually explains what's really
       going on.
     * Pointed out that Macintosh-style newlines break the csv2
       parser's ability to tell the user what line the error is
       on (This should generally not be a practical issue, since
       it is uncommon for people to use this text file format;
       it's too close to 1.2.00 to fix this).
     * Update to the ej2man script so we don't have a raw
       accented character in the maradns man page (we use the
       ROFF \('a instead)

     (2005.12.21)

   maradns-1.1.91:

     This is the second release candidate for MaraDNS 1.2.

     Here are the changes from 1.1.90:
     * Made all manpage headings all-caps, to be consistent with
       standard manpage style.
     * Updated "unsupported features" part of MaraDNS man page
       to point out that 1.2 now supports more non-RFC1035 DNS
       features
     * Plain text documents in a more easily found directory
       (doc/en/text instead of doc/en/tutorial/text).
     * Added a modified version of Paul Sowden and Peter-Paul
       Koch's styleswitcher.js file so that people who need a
       large font to read a web page can get the large font with
       just one click.
     * Updated the authoritative and recursive tutorial
       documents to cover the case of wanting a recursive name
       server to have private host names.
     * Explicitly tell the user /etc/mararc is not being
       replaced during make install process.
     * Updated the FAQ for version 1.2 of MaraDNS.
     * Split up the DNS introduction document and the list of
       all tutorials, usage guides, and man pages.
     * Added makefile in webpage document (now I have a
       one-command way of updating the MaraDNS webpage).
     * Spelling errors checked and corrected in all tutorial and
       man page documents.

     (2005.12.14)

   maradns-1.1.90:

     This is the first release candidate of MaraDNS 1.2. Should
     no one report any problems with this release, this will be
     released, unchanged, as MaraDNS 1.2.00 on December 21.

     Here are the changes from 1.1.61:
     * Fixed some bugs in the ej2man script; the man pages now
       look nicer.
     * Added a new EJ tag: HIBIT; this allows some EJ output to
       contain hi-bit characters (such as HTML pages) while
       other EJ output has equivalent content with no hi-bit
       characters (such as man pages, which don't take well to
       non-ASCII)
     * Fixed rendering problems with the pdf manpage reference
       (I updated ps2pdf to the one from the latest 8.53
       Ghostscript) and added the csv2_txt man page to this
       reference (HIBIT makes this now possible).
     * Renamed security_design.html security.html to make it
       clear this is a document about MaraDNS' security.

     (2005.12.07)

   maradns-1.1.61:

     * Document minor updates: default value of timestamp_type
       is now five (this was changed in 1.1.60); Clarify that
       maradns needs to be restarted to reload zones in DNSslave
       document; corrected misspelled words and minor
       grammatical errors in the Quick Start guide
     * Mac OS X port: MaraDNS sucessfully compiles on Mac OS X
       (Darwin) again; all compile-time warnings removed.
     * MinGW32 port: Changed port to use #ifdef statements
       instead of a patch to make source Win32-compatible; this
       allows me to make source changes without having to
       constantly update the mingw32 patch.

     (2005.12.05)

   maradns-1.1.60:

     * Authoritative tutorial expanded and updated
     * DNS master document written; DNS tcp document updated
     * Procedure for making text files updated
     * Text files for tutorial added
     * Examples added to "dangling" document
     * Updated spec file to include maradns.zoneserver startup
       script
     * Removed OSRC (open-rsc.org doesn't resolve) and Alternic
       (alternic.org owned by squatter) from example full mararc
       file
     * Added document on being a DNS slave
     * Verified that shell scripts in dnsslave document work
     * Created document on updating from MaraDNS 1.0 to 1.2
       (most of the time, change nothing)
     * Many other tutorial improvments
     * Verified spelling of all tutorial documents
     * mararc man page correction: csv1 zone files are for
       MaraDNS 1.0, not 1.X
     * HR tag added to ej specification.

     (2005.12.03)

   maradns-1.1.59:

     * Cygwin port fix: ipv6 not compiled in authonly mode on
       Cygwin (Cygwin doesn't yet have ipv6)
     * Updated RPM-building spec file for the 1.1 branch of
       MaraDNS

     (2005.11.28)

   maradns-1.1.58:

     * Cleaned up the FreeBSD compile
     * Cleaned up the Cygwin compile; MaraDNS compiles on Cygwin
       again
     * Removed all warnings seen when compiling on Cygwin
       (Cygwin GCC is a little more pedantic than Linux GCC)
     * Updated the Mingw32 patch
     * Fixed issue with install script (see mailing list)

     (2005.11.23)

   maradns-1.1.57:

     * Partial port of MaraDNS to mingw32 (can you say
       maradns.exe) done.
     * Since 127.0.0.3 doesn't work on many systems, changing
       all loopback examples to use the IP address 127.0.0.1;
       also changing Askmara's default server address to
       127.0.0.1

     (2005.11.21)

   maradns-1.0.35:

     * Backport of 1.1.x fix of csv1 example in documentation
     * Backport of 1.1.x fix of MINFO RR description
     * Backport of 1.1.x security fix.

     (2005.11.20)

   maradns-1.1.56:

     * SECURITY FIX: Made the RNG algorithm resistant to cache
       sniffing attacks. See this page for a full description of
       this security issue.
     * Modified configure script to not compile on unsupported
       systems.

     (2005.11.20)

   maradns-1.1.55:

     * This is the first Beta-test release for the up-and-coming
       MaraDNS 1.2
     * Fixed description of minfo RR in DNS compression code
     * Fixed askmara to correctly output SOA and RAW records
     * Changed zoneserver to use select() model for handling the
       processing of child process' output (thanks, Albert)
     * Initialized some uninitialized variables (thanks again,
       Albert)
     * Added Albert Lee to CREDITS file
     * Removed perl and gawk dependencies from franky.hosts.test
       test (the only thing we now need to pull from ports on
       FreeBSD to run this is Bash)
     * Alpha-level SQA testing done.

     (2005.11.18)

   maradns-1.1.54:

     * Updated csv1tocsv2.pl and ej2man scripts to be able to
       use a Perl interpreter that is not in /usr/bin
     * Both UIDs that the zoneserver becomes are now determined
       by the "maradns_uid" mararc variable.
     * The zoneserver now uses the "maradns_gid" variable.
     * Corrected spelling of "privileges"

     (2005.11.14)

   maradns-1.1.53:

     * SQA: Added scripts to help with Y2038 testing
     * Y2038 fix: MaraDNS is now fully functional before and
       after the Y2038 turnover on systems with 32-bit
       timestamps.
     * Update year_2038_statement; MaraDNS is now
       Y2038-compliant.
     * Updated Y2038 libraries to be thread-safe
     * Bug fix: A hostname can now be the first line in a csv2
       zone file
     * Doc fix: Fixed broken "U" record example in csv1 man page
     * Bug fix: The zoneserver now makes upper-case domain names
       lower-case
     * Bug fix: The zoneserver now correctly serves csv2 star
       records

     (2005.11.09)

   maradns-1.1.52:

     * Took care of segfault that only happened in FreeBSD
     * Made non-root running of MaraDNS possible again
     * Added FreeBSD-specific Makefiles

     (2005.11.06)

   maradns-1.0.34:

     * Hotfix: recursion works again
     * Regression procedure added.

     (2005.10.26)

   maradns-1.0.33:

     * Fixed occassional crash that happens while reading zone
       files at MaraDNS startup.
     * Fixed occassional compression error which shows up in
       MaraDNS logs.
     * Update man page to point out some unimplemented features
       will be in 1.2

     (2005.10.24)

   maradns-1.1.51:

     * Bug fix: hide_disclaimer is now case insensitive (any
       three-letter string will now hide the disclaimer, in
       fact)
     * Bug fix: Unknown mararc variable error message will not
       have a \012 in it.
     * Added PDF file which is a printable reference of MaraDNS
       man pages
     * Fixed problems with synth_soa_origin and synth_soa_seria
     * Fixed js_append.3 man page (returns 0, not JS_SUCCESS, on
       success)

     (2005.10.23)

   maradns-1.1.50:

     * Fixed a bug which caused people to see compression errors
       (The bug was caused when a PTR record pointed to a
       non-existant record)
     * Web design touch-up: The web page is now centered (I
       found the code to force Firefox to always have a
       scrollbar like IE); looks better in MacIE/IE4/Opera 5;
       the handheld and printing stylesheets look better.
     * Cleanup of install script; csv2 zone file installed
       instead of csv1 zone file; etc.
     * Cleanup and clarification of default mararc file
     * Changed makefile in rng/ to keep the rng-32bit-tables.h
       file; this will make things easier for people trying to
       cross-compile MaraDNS
     * Made MaraDNS' default UID, GID, logger UID, and Duende
       chroot() directory defined near the beginning of
       MaraDns.h; this will make it easier for packagers to
       redefine these constants.
     * Fixed zoneserver to have enough default values so that it
       works with the included example mararc.
     * Fixed bugs in the serving of long packets over TCP;
       MaraDNS can now serve long DNS packets over TCP, breaking
       the 512-byte limit.
     * askmara now correctly outputs multi-chunk TXT records
       (unless called with -v)
     * Two new mararc varables added: synth_soa_origin and
       synth_soa_serial. These are here mainly so that people
       who test MaraDNS 1.2 domains over at dnsreport.com can
       have a synthetic SOA record that doesn't generate any
       errors.

     (2005.10.20)

   maradns-1.1.49:

     * Revised pages on the web page to have a minimum number of
       HTML errors. (Let's keep the validator fairly happy)
     * Added a new feature, long_packet_ipv4, which will allow
       packets longer then 512 bytes long (compressed) to be
       sent from MaraDNS via TCP (we have a list of IPs which we
       can send UDP packets longer than 512 bytes to; zoneserver
       translates these packets to standards-conforming TCP
       packets). This is only enabled if MaraDNS is compiled as
       an authoritative-only nameserver.
     * MaraDNS now generates no warning when compiled with GCC
       3.4.2 as both an authoritative-only nameserver and as a
       recursive nameserver.
     * MaraDNS, when compiled as an authoritative-only
       nameserver, now compiles with the name maradns.authonly.
       The install and startup scripts have been revised to
       reflect this change.
     * Tutorial for doing DNS over TCP has been created.
     * Updated security design document and added all known
       security problems to the document
     * Updated startup script to add a script (disabled by
       default) which starts up MaraDNS' zoneserver.

     (2005.10.08)

   maradns-1.1.48:

     * Fixed bugs in mararc processing so that a mararc file
       with only three lines (four for an authoritative
       nameserver) works again.
     * Updated all of the documentation to reflect the 1.1
       changes and updates to MaraDNS.
     * Updated web page design of MaraDNS web page; the page
       will look almost identical on a modern CSS browser on a
       PC (including IE 5/6) but will look better on non-CSS
       browsers, handheld browsers, and when printed out.
       Additionally, there is a "large print" style that makes
       the web page more accessible.

     (2005.10.04)

   maradns-1.1.47:

     * Set up recursive stress test to make sure recursive
       resolver doesn't leak memory nor crash (it doesn't)
     * Working on updating the CSS for MaraDNS's web page to
       look better in non-CSS browsers (Changes aren't live yet;
       look at mixed_css_try3)
     * csv2 security updates:
       1. The hostname for a record must be at the beginning of
       a line.
       2. No more than one pipe (|) character is allowed between
       csv2 fields.
     * Documentation updates: Recursive tutorial updated to
       reflect the fact that a recursive server now only needs a
       3-line mararc file.

     (2005.10.01)

   maradns-1.1.46:

     * Issue with recursive ANY queries resolved
     * All compile-time warnings removed; MaraDNS now compiles
       with zero warnings when compiled with -Wall

     (2005.09.25)

   maradns-1.1.45:

   This release is the last 1.1.x release which adds new
   features to MaraDNS. Until MaraDNS 1.2.00 is release, the
   only changes will be documentation updates and bugfixes.

     * I have removed maragen until it can be updated to use the
       csv2 zone files.
     * Some doc cleanup; removing outdated documents in
       doc/en/misc, merging the old changelog with the current
       changelog, etc.
     * CNAME records will now give, in the answer section, the
       record the CNAME record points to for any RR type, not
       just A (and to a limited extent, PTR) records.
     * ANY queries now more-or-less work with recursive queries
       again.
     * Bogus SOA "not there" replies now have a narrower scope
       than ".".
     * Fixed problem with empty TXT and RAW records in
       csv1tocsv2.pl

     (2005.09.24)

   maradns-1.1.44:

     * The RCODE in the DNS headers will now correctly return a
       NXDOMAIN as long as there are no RRs with the given DNS
       name in question. Otherwise, the RCODE returned is zero.
     * Added a new tool in the tools directory, called
       csv1tocsv2.pl, which is a Perl script that converts csv1
       zone files in to csv2 zone files.

     (2005.09.13)

   maradns-1.1.43:

     * MaraDNS 1.0.32 bugfix forward-ported to 1.1.43
     * Duende will now output error on standard out when it dies
       unexpectably

     (2005.08.10)

   maradns-1.0.32:

     Hotfix: RR rotation now works again.
     (2005.08.08)

   maradns-1.0.31:

     Two patches by Albert Lee that improve Mara's stability.
     (2005.08.07)

   maradns-1.0.30:

     * Warn the user when they have dangling CNAME records
     * Fix bug with MX records with preferences > 255 in getzone
       tool

     (2005.06.30)

   maradns-1.1.42:

     * Removed debug information showing in hex the bind address
     * ipv6 logging now works
     * hide_disclaimer works again
     * The code to handle ANY queries is essentially completely
       rewritten.

     (2005.06.22)

   maradns-1.1.41:

     * Make all example ipv6 addresses 3ffe:ffff example
       addresses
     * New mararc variable: csv2_synthip_list
     * Get the zoneserver to read ipv4_bind_addresses and
       csv2_synthip_list
     * Allow spaces in ip_acl lists
     * Document: How to set up a default zonefile
     * Give out a bogus SOA reply when none of the servers for
       the domain can be reached.

     (2005.06.12)

   maradns-1.1.40:

     * Warning now shown for dangling cname records
     * bind_address now has ipv4_bind_addresses name
       (bind_address still works, of course)

     (2005.06.07)

   maradns-1.1.39:

     * MaraDNS now has full authoritative-only ipv6 support

     (2005.06.05)

   maradns-1.1.38:

     * Fixed security problem with new fetchzone tool. More
       details in in the maradns-1.1.37-fetchzone_security.patch
       file
     * Added support for dos_protection_level which will disable
       certain MaraDNS features to make her respond more quickly
       to DNS requests; this is useful for very highly loaded
       servers or for surviving denial-of-service attacks.
     * Wrote code to support binding to ipv6 addresses when
       MaraDNS is compiled as an authoritative-only nameserver.
       Work on this will continue when I get ip6 up and going on
       my Fedora Core 3 box.

     (2005.05.28)

   maradns-1.1.37:

     * Support for stars at the end of hostnames is finished.
     * Added ability to compile MaraDNS without recursive
       support; this makes the binary 20% smaller and not need
       the pthread library.

     (2005.05.21)

   maradns-1.1.36:

     * Forward-ported the MaraDNS 1.0.29 changes in to the 1.1
       branch.
     * Applied Juergen's patch so that the 1.1 branch compiles
       again.
     * Added code to work around Linux' select() before the
       recvfrom() in MaraDNS.c

     (2005.05.14)

   maradns-1.0.29:

     This release improves how MaraDNS' recursive resolver
     parses packets so that Mara can interoperate better with
     some stub resolvers that don't bother looking past the
     header of a DNS packet.

     (2005.05.13)

   maradns-1.1.35:

     This release forward-ports the improvments for MaraDNS
     1.0.27 and MaraDNS 1.0.28 in to the 1.1 branch.
     (2005.05.06)

   maradns-1.0.28:

     The reason why MaraDNS' recursive resolver has been
     freezing up is because of a bug in the Linux kernel that
     the kernel developers are not interested in resolving. I
     would like to thank Albert Lee for providing a patch which
     resolves this issue.

     (2005.05.06)

   maradns-1.0.27:

     * Patch to address possible security concern with the
       random number generator.
     * Some updates to the documentation

     (2005.05.02)

   maradns-1.1.34:

     * MaraDNS now supports stars at the end of hostnames. The
       only part of this feature that needs to be implemented is
       the ability to correctly handle the case when someone
       asks for a hostname or record type that the star does not
       catch.

     (2005.04.30)

   maradns-1.1.33:

     * zoneserver now supports binding to multiple IP addresses

     (2005.04.18)

   maradns-1.1.32:

     * Patched 1.1 branch so that it compiles on older versions
       of GCC again
     * Made the ICANN list of root nameservers a default list,
       hardcoded in the MaraDNS code, if the user doesn't
       specify root servers in their mararc file. It is now
       possible to have a 3-line mararc file.
     * Updated the quickstart guide to use the 3-line mararc
       example.
     * Initialized variables that were uninitialized.
     * Modified the mararc parser to exit on a fatal error if an
       unknown mararc variable is seen.
     * Mofified the relevent zonefile parsing code to correctly
       parse the "default" zonefile (zone file with stars at end
       of hostnames).

     (2005.04.09)

   maradns-1.0.26:

     Changes from 1.0.25:
     * Small patch so MaraDNS will compile on older versions of
       GCC again

     (2005.03.25)

   maradns-1.1.31:

     Changes from 1.1.30:
     * Updated the zone file parser to improve (read: Make more
       pedantic) parsing of hostnames with '*' characters in
       them.
     * Removed all compile-time warnings.
     * New mararc variable, csv2_default_zonefile, created.

     (2005.03.25)

   maradns-1.1.30:

     Changes from 1.1.29:
     * Updated tutorial and list of ICANN root servers. Cleaned
       up root server lists in example mararcs (we no longer
       need long lines in mararc files)
     * Added verbose_query mararc variable

     (2005.03.16)

   maradns-1.0.25:

     Changes from 1.0.24:
     * Upgraded the ICANN root nameservers and other elements of
       the documentation
     * MaraDNS 1.0.xx compiles with no warning when compiled
       with -Wall again
     * Added verbose_query mararc variable

     (2005.03.16)

   maradns-1.1.29:

     Changes from 1.1.28:
     * Updated macro processor to make any and all '{'
       characters in zone files illegal. This will break csv2
       zone files with '{' characters currently in them.
     * Updated install script to install duende tool and man
       page
     * Updated MaraDNS startup script to use duende to invoke
       MaraDNS
     * Updated the Quick Start guide and the MaraDNS man page to
       note duende daemonizing tool.
     * Added debugging output which will hopefully make the
       recursive server occassionally freezing problem
       reproducible and fixable.

     (2005.03.05)

   maradns-1.1.28:

     Changes from 1.1.27:
     * Fixed bug with loading of synthetic SOA records in CSV2
       zone files
     * Updated roadmap to clarify goals for 1.2/2.0 release
     * Zoneserver sucessfully transferred a zone to Bind 8.4.6
     * Zoneserver sucessfully transferred a zone to Bind 9.2.4
     * Zoneserver sucessfully transferred a zone to Bind 9.3.0
     * Documentation for Duende tool updated to point out that
       the directory /etc/maradns/logger is mandatory for this
       tool
     * Incorporated Juergen's patch that installs the fetchzone
       tool and man page
     * alarm() call added to zoneserver to implement TCP timeout
     * askmara documentation cleaned up, improved

     (2005.02.26)

   maradns-1.1.27:

     Changes from 1.1.26:
     * The recursive resolver now works again (using 64-bit
       Y2038-safe timestamps, to boot).
     * Minor updates to documentation.

     (2005.02.24)

   maradns-1.1.26:

     Changes from 1.1.25:
     * Fixed bug where recursive server was outputting bad TTLs
       (I don't think this affects 1.0.xx)
     * Made a number of bug fixes to the zoneserver so that it
       correctly serves zones (and SOA records) as a zoneserver
     * Verified that the zoneserver works with the djbdns axfr
       client (axfr-get)
     * Updated askmara's output and updated fetchzone's
       csv2-compatible output

     (2005.02.23)

   maradns-1.1.25:

     Changes from 1.1.24:
     * Checked examples in TXT/RAW record documentation, making
       fixes to documentation and/or code as needed.
     * Corrected how askmara outputs TXT and raw records.
     * Added support for asking for arbitrary record types in
       askmara. Updated man page to reflect this change.
     * Changed examples in tutorial to not include SOA and NS
       records in example zone file; hopefully registars are no
       longer anal about this kind of thing.

     (2005.02.20)

   maradns-1.1.24:

     Changes from 1.1.23:
     * Fixed ej2man script to make correct ASCII single quotes
       in man pages.
     * Added csv2_txt manual page to document TXT and RAW
       records.
     * Added support for RAW (any RTYPE) records to the csv2
       parser.
     * Updated tutorial to use csv2 records.
     * Minor updates to the web page (there was a minor blemish
       in the rock face texture which I surgically removed with
       Gimp).
     * Mac OS X/Darwin fix for 1.0.24 integrated in to this
       release.

     (2005.02.19)

   maradns-1.1.23:

     Changes from 1.1.22:
     * Added support for TXT records to the CSV2 zone file.
     * Added files to create the core maradns.org webpage to the
       documentation.

     (2005.02.16)

   maradns-1.0.24:

     Changes from 1.0.23:
     * Fixed the build process on MacOS X so it compiles again.
     * Fixed some non-critical typos in the configure script.

     (2005.02.15)

   maradns-1.1.22:

     Note: This revison changes the format of csv2 zone files
     from 1.1.21; this will be the last incompatible change to
     csv2 zone files done. All future changes will be backwards
     compatible with csv2 zone files.
     * Fixed bug in csv2 parser where, when a newline causes a
       syntax error, the error is reported at the start of the
       new line instead of the end of the previous line.
     * Made sure dnames are converted to lowercase before being
       put in to the bighash
     * Got % shortcuts to work in the new csv2 zone files
     * csv2 records have the authority data (the NS records for
       the zone) added.
     * Synthesize ns records (have bogus names and have the NS
       ips be any non-private ip address we're bound to) if
       needed.
     * Added code to synthesize a SOA record for csv2 zone files
       without a SOA record.
     * Fixed bug that % doesn't work in dlabels in the data
       fields of an RR
     * There is a working example csv2 file which documents what
       the file does
     * Changed askmara to output records in csv2 format
     * Created fetchzone tool that outputs records in csv2
       format
     * ej2man and ej2txt no longer use unicode for bullets
     * There is now a man page for csv2 and fetchzone.
     * Fixied bug with not being able to have UTF-8 at the
       beginning of a host name.
     * fixed %-only MX exchanger bug
     * a bind address can not be 0.0.0.0 if we have csv2 zone
       files (we now have support for binding to multiple IPs;
       0.0.0.0 is a little buggy)
     * Moved TTL to be before the rtype to be more like Bind's
       and Posadis' zone files.
     * Moved TTL in fetchzone and askmara to be before the
       rtype.
     * Added support for SRV records; Sean is actually using
       these
     * Got the zoneserver to work with the new csv2 zone file
       (this took the lion's share of the work for the 1.1.22
       release)
     * Integrated Juergen Daubert's latest cleanup patches

     (2004.06.30)

   maradns-1.1.21:

     * show_esc_stdout moved from parse/ParseCsv1.c to the more
       sensible libs/JsStrOS.c.
     * Code for parsing ipv6 addresses written (it took 355
       lines to parse stuff like "ffe:501:ffff::b:c:d"; compare
       this to 125 lines for ddip_2_ip which does the ipv4
       equivalent)
     * Support for CSV2 zone files is about 80% done; combined
       with the ipv6 address parsing, we're looking at 2348 new
       lines of code.

     (2004.06.18)

   maradns-1.1.20:

     (Release 1.1.19 skipped because that was an accidental
     release I did last October)
     * Changed tools to create utf-8 instead of Latin-1 man
       pages (Fedora Core Two does not like Latin-1 encoded man
       pages).
     * Added support for the += operator in the mararc file.
       This operator is use for string concatenation. The goal
       (along with the csv2 file format) is to make it so
       MaraDNS never needs a line longer than 80 colums in a
       configuration file.
     * Hopefully fixed bugs with mixed-case domain names.

     (2004.06.03)

   maradns-1.1.18:

     This is a merge of the features present in MaraDNS 1.0.23
     but not in 1.1.17 in to the 1.1.xx branch. Additionally, I
     have some ideas for a new zone file format in doc/en/misc
     (more like, I have a full definition of a finite state
     machine complete with psudo-code for processing of
     everything in this new proposed zone file format).
     Compiles, but I don't know if this runs.

     (2004.06.01)

   maradns-1.0.23:

     Changes from 1.0.22:
     * Corrected error where askmara incorrectly outputted MX
       records
     * MaraDNS can now resolve star records when processing ANY
       queries
     * The RD value in replies is now the same as the RD in the
       corresponding query
     * Fixed some typos in old changelog entries

     (2004.05.28)

   maradns-1.0.22:

     Changes from 1.0.21:
     * Applied Juergen Daubert's patch that makes MaraDNS
       compile clean, even with all warnings enabled.
     * Added testing for the zoneserver to the SQA suite
     * Fixed a problem where the zone server would die after
       serving MAXFD zones.

     (2004.05.25)

   maradns-1.0.21:

     This is MaraDNS 1.0.20 with a patch that solves an error
     one user reported with the parsing of zone files.

     (2004.04.13)

   maradns-1.0.20:

     This is MaraDNS 1.0.18 with a patch to allow gnu.org to
     resolve again. This is the "no frills, just stay stable"
     branch of MaraDNS.

     (2003.10.02)

   maradns-1.1.18:

     This is simply a new release which indicates my decision
     to completely rewrite the recursive portion of MaraDNS.
     The old recursive code is removed; I hope to have time to
     work on the new recursive code soon.

     (2003.10.02)

   maradns-1.0.19:

     This is a test release which addresses a number of issues
     people on the list have brought up:
     * Doug Sampson a pointed out that the server gives out
       compression errors and freezes. I have replaced the
       compression code with the cleaner compression code from
       the 1.1.xx branch; this will hopefully address this
       issue.
     * Andrew pointed out that the zoneserver does not give out
       adequate error messages when there is a problem opening
       up a zone file, or when there is a fatal parse error in a
       zone file. I have added appropriate error messages to the
       zone server.
     * Juergen Daubert provided a patch to make Mara's compile
       generate less warnings.
     * A problem with the ORSC entries being out of date was
       brought up. I can not look up the current entries (being
       offline), but have changed all of the example files to
       use the ICANN entries by default, since ICANN is the only
       root server registry who has root servers with stable
       enough IPs for "set and forget" environments.
     * I myself found some problems where timeouts for PTR and
       AAAA queries can slow down poorly-written clients. As a
       result, MaraDNS now has the ability to optionally
       instantly give dummy "not there" replies to either PTR or
       AAAA queries (or both).
     * Some minor updates and clean-up to the documentation.

     (2003.08.03)

   maradns-1.1.17:

     Recursive queries now work again; fixed a place which was
     using a 32-bit value to get a timestamp, when the code in
     question should have used a josa_timestamp (64-bit) value.

     Additionally, it is now possible to use this program as a
     non-root user again.

     (2003.06.13)

   maradns-1.0.18:

     Cleaned up and fixed a bug in the MaraDNS startup script.
     Now, the only prorcesses that will be killed will be bona
     fide MaraDNS processes.

     (2003.05.30)

   maradns-1.0.17:

     Strnlen seems to not be a portable call after all (the
     BSDs don't have it); this version has a special js_strnlen
     call to make up for this.

     (2003.04.18)

   maradns-1.0.16:

     This is MaraDNS 1.0.15 declared "stable" (well, as stable
     as 1.0.13). The only change from 1.0.15 is more debugging
     information in case an unreproducable bug which one user
     reported pops up again.

     (2003.03.16)

   maradns-1.0.15:

     This is MaraDNS 1.0.14 with a good deal more stress
     testing done to the recursive resolver. There does not
     appear to be any obvious memory leaks; nor are there any
     stability issues with this release of MaraDNS. That said,
     I am, at present, marking the release "beta" until there
     is more field testing of the release.

     (2003.02.28)

   maradns-1.0.14:

     This is not a production release of MaraDNS. This is a
     beta-test release of MaraDNS which has the ptr-over-cname
     fix from the 1.1.xx branch backported to the 1.0.xx
     branch. In addition, the code has been modified to no
     longer use strlen().

     Use this code at your own risk. While I have stress-tested
     this code for stability, this code has not been field
     tested yet.

     That said, it does fix the long-standing bug with
     correctly resolving PTR records which are CNAME referrals.
     I want to see some people help me beta-test this, so that
     I can make a more general release of this bugfix
     available.

     (2003.02.23)

   maradns-1.0.13:

     This release of MaraDNS is dedicated to the seven brave
     astronauts who died this morning on the Columbia space
     shuttle:
     * Willie McCool
     * Rick Husband
     * Kalpana Chawla
     * Laurel Clark
     * Michael Anderson
     * David Brown
     * Ilan Ramon

     These people died expanding the boundaries of humanity's
     next frontier; may their deaths not be in vain and may
     humanity eventually conquer space.

     This is MaraDNS 1.0.12 with a one-line bugfix for a bug
     the last release of MaraDNS introduced. This only matters
     for people who have zonefiles with no records in them
     (besides the SOA and NS records for the domain head).

     (2003.02.01)

   maradns-1.1.16:

     D Richard Felker III, who knows more about the arcane
     mysteries of UNIX pipes than myself, showed me how to get
     duende to catch the stuff sent to standard error also.

     Duende's manual page has been proffread and updated.

     (2003.01.29)

   maradns-1.1.15:

     I have given up, for now, on trying to catch both stdout
     and stderr.

   maradns-1.1.14:

     The daemonizing helper has been renamed 'duende' (Spanish
     for 'daemon', consistant with the Spanish theme MaraDNS
     has, it is said like 'dwen-deh'), and now sets up a second
     child process which syslog()s all of maradns' various
     messages. Also added new timestamp format with no
     timestamp whatsoever to eliminate redundant timestamp when
     using duende helper.

     (2003.01.27)

   maradns-1.1.13:

     MaraDNS now has a daemonizing helper which makes MaraDNS a
     daemon, then stays around. If either the daemonizing
     helper or MaraDNS (even MaraDNS 1.0.xx) gets a HUP signal,
     MaraDNS is restarted. If either process gets a TERM or an
     INT signal, both processes exit. If MaraDNS exits for any
     other reason besides a HUP signal, the daemonizer restarts
     MaraDNS.

     (2003.01.25)

   maradns-1.1.12:

     MaraDNS now has her own timestamp code which should get
     rid of any Y2038 problems; on systems with 32-bit time_t,
     the problems are pushed forward to 2112 (and can be pushed
     forward indefinitely by changing only two magic constants
     and recompiling). Note: This means the code only works on
     systems with an int64_t; are there any significant Unix
     systems deployed which people may wish to use Mara on
     without int64 support at this point?

     (2003.01.22)

   maradns-1.1.11:

     MaraDNS has support for DNS record resurrection; this
     means that she can now use expired records if no DNS
     server can be contacted for a given host name

     (2003.01.17)

   maradns-1.0.12:

     MaraDNS with the following seven patches applied:
     * Records with CNAMEs should resolve more nicely on slow
       links (maradns-1.0.11-incomplete.cname.patch)
     * Askmara man page updated to say default DNS server
       address is 127.0.0.3 (maradns-1.0.11.askmara-man.patch)
     * Recursive server no longer wastes time with in-bailiwick
       glueless NS referrals (maradns-1.0.11-bailiwick.patch)
     * References to nslookup in the documentation have been
       removed, or changed to note that nslookup is obsolete
       (maradns-1.0.11.no-nslookup.patch)
     * Fixed problem that Ray reported with empty zone files
       (zone files with only SOA and NS records)
       (maradns-1.0.11-raybug.patch)
     * Fixed very slight problem with how the RNG was seeded,
       should not affect most installations of MaraDNS
       (maradns-1.0.11-rngseed.patch)
     * Patch to work around admins who use a dot instead of an @
       in the RNAME field for SOA record
       (maradns-1.0.11-soamail.patch)

     (2003.01.15)

   maradns-1.1.10:

     MaraDNS is now able to bind to multiple IP addresses. In
     addition, I have set up a signal handler so that MaraDNS
     can exit with a return code of 8 when she gets a HUP
     signal.

     The way MaraDNS binds to multiple IP addresses is by
     having a socket for each IP address, and a select() call
     which determines which socket someone connected to. Since
     the select() has a timeout, I was able to set up the HUP
     signal handler to only change a global variable.

     Proper HUP signal handling will be handled by a daemonizer
     wrapper, which I will write next.

     (2003.01.10)

   maradns-1.1.09:

     Some improvments to DNS-over-TCP:
     * It is now possible to have permission to only forward a
       query over TCP without being able to transfer zone file.
     * It is now possible to use an old zoneserver mararc with
       the new zoneserver.
     * The feature has now been documented (albeit only sparsely
       in the mararc man page)

     (2003.01.10)

   maradns-1.1.08:

     It is now possible to use zoneserver to forward TCP DNS
     queries to a UDP DNS server; this gives MaraDNS full TCP
     DNS support.

     (2003.01.07)

   maradns-1.1.07:

     Not extensively tested, but following CNAMEs to PTR
     records now works.

     (2002.12.25)

   maradns-1.0.11:

     This release changes the decompressor so that it works
     with packets which some zoneservers with large zone files
     generate.

     There is also some minor revisions to the documentation.

     (2002.12.17)

   maradns-1.0.10:

     This release fixes a bug with the RP definition so that
     the decompressor can accept a DNS packet with this RR
     type. In other words, this release resolves the problem
     Danny saw.

     In addition, I have done some documentation clean-up,
     fixing the problems that Christian saw in the
     documentation; the most significant change is that the
     root servers for various root server networks have been
     updated.

     (2002.11.30)

   maradns-1.0.09:

     This release backports the 1.1.06 improvments to the
     1.0.xx branch of MaraDNS.

     (2002.11.15)

   maradns-1.1.06:

     This realease updates the FAQ, some other information, and
     has some minor cleanups performed to the code.

     (2002.10.24)

   maradns-1.1.05:

     This release has the same decompression patch which the
     1.0.08 release has. In addition, this release has the
     test_zoneserver and test_getzone tools, just in case
     anyone ever sees problems with getzone again.

     (2002.10.05)

   maradns-1.0.08:

     The release fixes the problems which getzone which Marc
     Schneiders and Nikos Mavroyanopoulos reported. I would
     like to thank both people for reporting these problems.

     The problems were caused by the fact that the new
     decompression code did not expect the kind of packets
     which zoneserver generate; I have patched the new
     decompression code.

     (2002.10.05)

   maradns-1.1.04:

     This release incorporates TTL aging, and Jonathan's code
     which makes this run as a Win9x service (note: BSD
     copyrighted code with the obnoxious advertising clause; we
     may have to do something about that before this becomes
     stable code)

     (2002.09.01)

   maradns-1.0.07:

     I would like to thank Scott Cooper for working hard to
     find the cause of a bothersome crash which people have
     been reporting for about a month. This release, hopefully,
     fixes the crashing problem once and for all.

     In addition, I have put back all of the improvments to the
     authoritative half which MaraDNS between 0.9.06 and 1.0.05
     had; this version undoes the reverting I did for 1.0.06
     (which I only did because problems started popping up two
     days before a two-week vacation I had in México).

     (2002.08.26)

   maradns-1.0.06:

     Johan is seeing stability problems with MaraDNS'
     authoritative half which MaraDNS 0.9.06 does not have;
     this patch essentially reverts the authoritative half to
     what MaraDNS 0.9.06 had.

     This hopefully fixes the stability problems; I am alas in
     a position to properly test this.

     (2002.07.30)

   maradns-1.0.05:

     Simple one-line change which allows MaraDNS to compile on
     Cygwin. Calling this release a "stable" release.

     (2002.07.28)

   maradns-1.1.02:

     The following improvments over MaraDNS 1.1.01:
     * All improvments made for MaraDNS 1.0.04 have been
       integrated in to the development branch.
     * A bug which caused MaraDNS 1.1.01 to seg fault has been
       fixed
     * This version of MaraDNS now supports human-readable
       timestamps

     (2002.07.18)

   maradns-1.0.04:

     MaraDNS 1.0.03 with the following patches:
     * Jon's patch which allows any arbitrary size for the debug
       memory allocation checking hash.
     * Christian's improved German translations.
     * Franky's improvments to recursive.c
     * Richard's changes which allow MaraDNS to compile on
       Cygwin (again)

     (2002.07.14)

   maradns-1.1.01:

     The first (real) release of the new development tree. This
     is MaraDNS 1.0.02 with a new license (simple BSD-style
     license which will hopefully attract developers scared off
     by the "Public Domain opens you up to lawsuits" FUD) and a
     newly rewritten compression engine.

     (2002.07.14)

   maradns-1.0.03:

     Franky's second release. This contains the following
     improvements:
     * Removed the thread limit of 125 (changed it to 500
       because a limit is always needed)
     * Removed the Solaris-refuses-to-run-recursive limitation
     * Changed the locking scheme; all memory leaks seem to
       vanish using the new scheme.
     * Fixed some minor memory leaks

     (2002.07.12)

   maradns-1.0.02:

     This is a release of my own. This 1.0.01 with the
     following changes:
     * An audit was done on the decompression code. While no
       exploitable security problems were found, some clean up
       to make things more consistent was done.
     * A patch which tells us the IP from which a packet the
       decompresser didn't like was sent.
     * A patch which shows us the packet before decompressing it
       at a sufficiently high log level.
     * A patch which fixes a bug when the last record in the DNS
       packet had a rdlength of 0; the decompressor previously
       erroneously rejected these packets.

     (2002.06.30)

   maradns-1.0.01:

     This is Franky's first release. Mainly, some more minor
     memory leaks plugged.

     The only changes I made were some touch ups to the
     documentation, and added a copy of Franky's GPG key signed
     with the MaraDNS signing key.

     (2002.06.26)

   maradns-0.5.33:

     Now that 1.0.00 is released, I am deprecating the 0.5.xx
     branch. The only updates to this branch will be to fix
     bugs worth disclosing on Bugtraq. In other words, security
     bugs.

     If anyone wants to maintain this branch of MaraDNS, let me
     know.

     This release back ports some cleanup I did with
     dns/Queries.c which also applies to the 0.5.xx branch.

     (2002.06.21)

   maradns-1.0.00: (released as close to 2002's solstice as
   possible)

     It's here. Happy solstice everyone!

     MaraDNS 0.9.92 with the following patches:
     * Yet another memleak patch
     * Patch which properly initializes the header data
       structure
     * Franky patch (modified) to fix things up
     * Neale's maragen added to the tree

     (2002.06.21)

   maradns-0.9.92: (1.0 release candidate 2)

     MaraDNS 0.9.91 with the following patches:
     * Neale's patch which fixes a small problem in the
       install.sh script
     * Franky's patch which fixes up the locks
     * My patch to a possible memory leak that Franky found

     (2002.06.15)

   maradns-0.9.91: (1.0 release candidate 1)

     MaraDNS 0.9.39 with the following patches:
     * Franky's patch which fixes a problem with the thread
       locking (The "Small Fix" patch)
     * Patch which fixes the recent rcode problems
     * Patch which limits the number of threads to 125
     * Patch which removes compile-time warnings
     * Patch which adds note in documtation that MaraDNS doesn't
       handle in-bailiwick glueless NS referrals very well.

     (2002.06.12)

   maradns-0.9.39:

     MaraDNS 0.9.38 with the following patches:
     * Franky's patch which reworks some of the locks. Seems to
       mimimize the thread overlap problems.
     * Patch which warns us if we unlock when there is no thread
       locked.
     * Patch which plugs a memory leak in Decompress.c.

     (2002.06.10)

   maradns-0.9.38:

     Added code to check the pthread locking status and to exit
     if it doesn't return a sucessful exit code.

     Removed timestamp format which allows us to see the PID;
     this was only needed for debugging purposes.

     Added comment in the MaraDNS source explaining why 200 is
     a reasonable maximum number of threads; that is about how
     many simutanious threads the underlying pthread library
     can handle.

     (2002.06.08)

   maradns-0.9.37:

     This is MaraDNS 0.9.36 with the following patches:
     * maradns-0.9.36.dotafter.patch: Fixes problems with the
       "dot after .com"
     * maradns-0.9.36.decompress.patch: Fixes problems
       decompressing TXT records
     * maradns-0.9.36.cleanup.patch: Clean up recursive code;
       stops potential release of lock
     * maradns-0.9.36.bind.patch: MaraDNS now tries 10 times to
       bind to a port; should make her handle medium-to-high
       loads better
     * maradns-0.9.36.showpid.patch: Gives new option to
       show_timestamp to show the process ID.

     Also: Minor doc change (to document the new timestamp
     format); updated RPM spec, changelog, and download page

     (2002.06.07)

   maradns-0.9.36:

     The new decompression code now works. Enabling it so
     people can test it.

     (2002.06.05)

   maradns-0.9.35:

     Improved RPM spec files

     The new decompression code is finished, but is not fully
     debugged yet (so it is disabled for this release).

     Code cleanups which should resolve the infinite loops
     Franky is seeing

     (2002.06.04)

   maradns-0.9.34:

     Yet another debug release; numerous small bug fixes and
     cleanups. MaraDNS now builds correctly when the locale of
     outputted messages is set to Spanish or German again. A
     bug where MaraDNS would crash in a certain very unusual
     case has been fixed.

     (2002.05.31)

   maradns-0.9.33:

     Another debug release; numerous small bug fixes. The most
     notable is the plugging of what appears to be the last
     memory leak in the recursive code; hopefully all I have to
     do for 1.0.00 at this point is the new decompression code
     and the release candidates.

     (2002.05.21)

   maradns-0.9.32:

     Another debug release; the code which keeps track of
     unallocated memory has been redone. Now memory leak
     tracking causes a minimum of slowdown when running
     MaraDNS; and the code works again.

     In addition, some minor touchups have been done to the
     code.

     (2002.05.19)

   maradns-0.9.31:

     Begin work on new decompression code (still using old
     decompression code until new code is complete)

     Fixing open socket leaks in recursive code, and
     case-sensitivity issues in the askmara code.

     (2002.05.18)

   maradns-0.9.30:

     Another bug fix release: Fixed bug where RRs with
     obscenely long TTLs would "wrap around" and end up having
     a negative TTL (causing the record to be promptly erased
     from the cache). Now the maximum TTL is two years long.

     Added a little more in the way of debugging messages to
     try to get to the bottom of the temporary freeze-ups that
     Franky is seeing.

     (2002.05.17)

   maradns-0.9.29:

     Bug fix release: Fix bug where hosts that were in
     bailiwick were, at times, rejected as being out of
     bailiwick.

     (2002.05.15)

   maradns-0.9.28:

     Added new level of verbosity, 4, which records every time
     we add or remove a record from the cache

     (2002.05.13)

   maradns-0.9.27:

     timestamp_type feature added; it is now easy for people to
     add new timestamp types; this seems to be a popular
     request ever since MaraDNS had added timestamps.

     (2002.05.10)

   maradns-0.5.32:

     Backport of fixes to compression code to the 0.5.xx
     branch.

     (2002.05.10)

   maradns-0.9.26:

     Hot fix: The compression code was completely broken in
     MaraDNS 0.9.25 because I accidently made an integer which
     needs to be signed unsigned. Fixed.

     (2002.05.09)

   maradns-0.9.25:

     Bug fix: I finally have gotten to the bottom of the
     compression problems MaraDNS was having with news.com.com;
     this release fixes the problems, hopefully once and for
     all.

     I also have a document which describes some of the
     function calls the new decompression code will have.

     (2002.05.09)

   maradns-0.9.24:

     Bug fixes:
     * DNS records with a TTL of less than 30 seconds now have a
       visible TTL of 30 seconds. This is to work around stub
       resolvers (such as Mozilla's stub resolver) which can not
       resolve RRs with extremely short TTLs.
     * Lines which are too long in mararc files now return a
       properly formatted error message.

     I have begun work on the new decompressor; however no
     changes have been made to the actual compression code yet.
     However, there are now documents that specify how the new
     decompression will work and header files which the new
     decompression code will use.

     (2002.05.08)

   maradns-0.9.23:

     Bug fix: The mara.startup script now points to the same
     file location as the default install.location. Note that
     the startup script needs to be changed if moving the
     install location.

     Updated spec and patch file to build RPM for the current
     MaraDNS build; it has been too long since the last RPM
     release.

     Trivia: Cinco de Mayo celebrates a battle that Mexico won
     in 1862 in Puebla, Mexico (I visited the site of the
     battle several times when I was down there; it is a
     beautiful eucalyptus forest, having a beautiful fountain
     and planetarium) against the French. As it turned out, the
     French won the war, but Mexico won that one battle, which
     has been celebrated since then. Also, with the exception
     of Puebla, Cinco de Mayo is not a big holiday in Mexico;
     only in the US.

     (2002.05.05; Cinco de Mayo)

   maradns-0.9.22:

     Created list of issues to be resolved before the 1.0
     release of MaraDNS; once these are done, I will start a
     0.99.x branch; which I will publically announce.

     Added kludge to work around unreproducable problems where
     the compressor can not always compress a DNS packet

     Added link to glassary entries in the tutorial every time
     the tutorial intoduces a new term.

     (2002.05.04)

   maradns-0.9.21:

     Fixed bug where the minimum TTL for CNAME entires could
     not be separately set.

     Added stub resolver which generates unix timestamps as
     bogus A records; used for testing.

     Added FAQ entry about MaraDNS' time stamp format.

     (2002.05.02)

   maradns-0.9.20:

     Changed udperror so that it will tell us from where
     udperror was called; this will hopefully help me fix the
     news.com.com problems MaraDNS is having.

     Added time stamp to some logged requests and added source
     IP logging.

     Added the ability for a remote query to get MaraDNS'
     internal timestamp; this is only enabled at obscenely high
     levels of debug_msg_level, since it is a security risk
     (there are attacks which are more effective if we know the
     target's clock value).

     Minimum TTL and Minimum TTL for CNAME records is now
     user-customizable.

     (2002.04.24)

   maradns-0.9.19:

     Added download.html to maradns.org web pages which are
     converted here; this allows the pages which change most
     frequently on maradns.org to be changed offline.

     Added FAQ Q&A about a problem that someone was having;
     hopefully the next user with the problem will be able to
     use this information.

     Added incomplete ej2dbk converter which converts from ej
     to docbook. This is incomplete; after MaraDNS 1.0 I will
     add code which closes open tags and what not so the
     generated docbook is 100% legal.

     (2002.04.16)

   maradns-0.9.18:

     Fixed a bug in askmara where non-ASCII characters were not
     properly replaced by escape sequences.

     Updated EJ documentation tools so that they can now
     generate webpages in the same format as the web pages on
     www.maradns.org.

     (2002.03.25)

   maradns-0.9.17:

     Added a minor new feature (since it was trivial to add,
     and since it is a feature which greatly expands the
     functionality that MaraDNS has): upstream_servers. This
     allows MaraDNS to be used to contact other recursive
     servers when run in recursive mode.

     Further bugfixing and revision of the debug.hostname tool;
     it now will not get stuck in endless loops trying to
     resolve a given hostname.

     (2002.03.14)

   maradns-0.9.16:

     Converted encoding of all files in the MaraDNS source tree
     from ISO 8859-1 to UTF-8 (with the exception of one file
     in the utf8 directory which is supposed to be ISO 8859-1
     data). Fixed EJ tools so that they can work on a current
     (as of early 2002; RedHat 7.2) Linux system using the
     UTF-8 encoding without undue hassle.

     Fixed bug in debug.hostname where it would not resolve
     host names in certain circumstances.

     (2002.03.12)

   maradns-0.9.15:

     Added '-n' option to askmara so askmara can send the same
     kinds of DNS queries that recursive DNS servers send out
     (DNS queries that do not ask for recursion)

     Fixed bug where 'make install' would overwrite
     /etc/rc.d/init.d/maradns

     Changed maxprocs limit to 200 and made it so exceeding
     maxprocs does not cause MaraDNS to stop; instead maxprocs
     is reset to 200.

     (2002.03.06)

   maradns-0.9.14:

     Rewrote debug.hostname tool; this will allow me to set up
     the testbed to find the more obscure MaraDNS bugs.

     (2002.03.03)

   maradns-0.9.13:

     Fixed bug where debug_msg_level could only be changed if
     recursion was enabled.

     Changed stress testing simulation to simulate network lag
     in processing DNS replies.

     Made maxprocs have a hard limit of 100; making maxprocs
     have a value of 400 results in MaraDNS hanging on Linux
     systems.

     (2002.02.25)

   maradns-0.9.12:

     Cleanups performed so that all files to be audited to be
     compiled with -Wall enabled without generating any
     warnings.

     Fixed ej2txt so that it no longer generates utf-8 quotes.

     (2002.02.19)

   maradns-0.9.11:

     Fixed bug where CNAME records obtained from the cache
     would not work with stub resolvers, since the code changed
     the question in the question section of the reply.

     'make debug' now works again.

     (2002.02.11)

   maradns-0.9.10:

     Fixed bug of case where there is a CNAME record, and
     something happened when trying to get an A record for the
     CNAME record. Previously, MaraDNS would think the CNAME
     record had no A record until the CNAME record was purged
     from the cache. Now, MaraDNS is smart enough to store
     CNAME records with an A record of "a 'no such host' reply
     was found when we looked for an A record"; and CNAME
     records without any corresponding A record only stay in
     the cache for 30 seconds.

     If data is already in the cache for a given record, and
     the data has not expired, then there is no need to spawn a
     thread to process the record; now MaraDNS no longer does
     this. This should result in greater stability and less
     memory usage, since many operating systems do threads
     poorly.

     askmara now can have a user-defined timeout

     compile flags changed from -g to -O2

     (2002.02.11)

   maradns-0.9.09:

     Added data_structures.ej document, which describes the
     internal data structures that MaraDNS uses.

     Updated the mararc man page to describe the new
     debug_msg_level variable

     Added files needed to make MaraDNS RPM files in the build/
     directory.

     (2002.01.27)

   maradns-0.9.08:

     Fixed another bug in the ej2man script; it now correctly
     zaps blockquotes inside ul.../ul lists.

     Made changelog an ej-compatible document; this allows the
     changelog to be an ASCII text file instead of an HTML file
     which a lot of UNIX-heads will prefer.

     Verified that MaraDNS 0.9.07 compiles on Darwin (a.k.a.
     Mac OS X) "out of the box"; this means that MaraDNS now
     compiles "out of the box" on Solaris; Linux; and Darwin.
     It also should compile on Cygwin; alas I do not have a
     working cygwin setup to verify this on. Between these four
     OSes, we cover all of the major flavors of UNIX: Linux is
     a little of everything; Solaris is a "System V" UNIX;
     Darwin is a BSD UNIX clone; and Cygwin is a pure POSIX
     implementation.

     (2002.01.25)

   maradns-0.9.07:

     Added new runtime parameter which can be seen when debug
     messages are enabled: The number of elements in the DNS
     cache.

     Added Makefile template which is a generate Makefile for
     systems which do not have flock() support; make this
     Makefile the default Makefile (instead of the Linux
     Makefile).

     (2002.01.24)

   maradns-0.9.06:

     Fixed bug in maradns startup script where the script would
     not correctly restart the MaraDNS processes.

     New mararc parameter added: debug_msg_level; this sets the
     level of information we can get about a running MaraDNS
     process by sending special DNS queries to MaraDNS.

     (2002.01.23)

   maradns-0.9.05:

     Revamping of the build process; placing most build-related
     files in a directory named "build"; MaraDNS now compiles
     and installs cleanly on Solaris; MaraDNS now has a system
     startup script which MaraDNS invokes at system startup
     time.

     (2002.01.21)

   maradns-0.9.04:

     Another documentation fix. Added new EJ tag: DTWIDTH

     This version now compiles on Solaris; and should compile
     on Darwin.

     (2002.01.18)

   maradns-0.9.03:

     Integrated Christian's spelling corrections and German
     translations in to the MaraDNS documentation.

     Minor bugfixes with the ej2man script.

     (2002.01.17)

   maradns-0.9.02:

     Document reorganization: MaraDNS now uses a new document
     format, EJ (which I created myself for MaraDNS
     documentation usage), which can be converted in to HTML
     documents, text documents, or in to man page sources. By
     having a stramlined documentation format, MaraDNS'
     documentation will be easier to manage, and easier to
     translate.

     Since the ej format allows other files to be embedded in
     documents, this eliminates having to revise multiple
     versions of the same document

     (2002.01.16)

   maradns-0.5.31:

     Backporting of compression security patch to the MaraDNS
     0.5.xx branch.

     (2002.01.10)

   maradns-0.9.01:

     Fixed security problem with the compression code which I
     found when performing an audit on the code. Other cleanup
     of the compression code.

     Updated the French documentation.

     Added some more information to the MaraDNS tutorial.

     Added (currently untested) Darwin (a.k.a. MacOS X)
     support.

     (2002.01.10)

   maradns-0.9.00:

     Plugged some memory leaks in the recursive code.

     Added Thomas Seyrat's French translation of the
     documentation

     Completed the tutorial

     Fixed bug where the zoneserver needed the mararc file
     specified to start.

     Updated documentation

     (2002.01.06)

   maradns-0.8.99a:

     OK, so I was wrong about the first post-0.8.99 release
     being MaraDNS 0.9.00.

     This is simply MaraDNS 0.8.99 with a 2-line patch which
     fixes a problem where MaraDNS 0.8.99 would crash.

     (2001.12.17)

   maradns-0.8.99:

     Since I found a some security problems when working on the
     MaraDNS-0.9.00 release, I am making this release available
     which appears to addresses the security problems.

     Changes since 0.8.35:
     * Jaakko's patch, in a modified form, has been applied.
     * Documentation touchups.
     * Askmara timeout increased.
     * Solaris recursive support dropped until I can get my
       hands on my Solaris CDs (and a PC to install Solaris on)
       in January (Solaris still has bugs which do not exist in
       Linux).
     * Updated test bed to handle NS referrals which point
       nowhere
     * Found and fixed a bug where MaraDNS would not close UDP
       connections when sendto returned an error
     * Fixed a problem that mhash_put_data had, where the DNS
       cache could become inconsistant in certain circumstances.
     * Fixed two other spots in recursive.c (in two of the
       add_closer routines) which could have potentially caused
       inconsistant data in the cache.
     * Got remove.rng to work again.

     I have changed the version number to maradns-0.8.99 to
     reflect the fact that the next release will almost
     certaintly be MaraDNS 0.9.00.

     (2001.12.08)

   maradns-0.8.35:

     Made the stress tests in sqa/testbed more extensive; they
     now crash recursive MaraDNS versions up to and including
     0.8.33.

     Found and plugged some memory leaks that MaraDNS had.

     Verified that MaraDNS can handle the stress tests--MaraDNS
     was able to handle 80.000 queries without crashing, and
     without growing after 10.000 or so queries were processed.

     (2001.11.17)

   maradns-0.8.34:

     Found and removed another crash-inducing bug.

     Modified askmara so that it generates somewhat
     csv1-compatible output. Also modified the debug.hostname
     tool so that it can handle the new askmara output.

     (2001.11.16)

   maradns-0.8.33:

     Yipee! No, I'm not talking about the fact that the evil
     Taliban are no longer in control of Kabul. I am talking
     about the fact that I found and removed another crasher
     bug in MaraDNS.

     I hope that this is the last crasher bug. Time to cross my
     fingers.

     (2001.11.13)

   maradns-0.8.32:

     This is the third beta test candidate for the recursive
     MaraDNS, since people are reporting serious stability
     problems with MaraDNS 0.8.30 and MaraDNS 0.8.31. While I
     am unable to reporduce the problems offline, I was able to
     reproduce the problem online (but only intermittently),
     and found some iffy-looking code which may be the root of
     the problem.

     This program passes all offline stress tests.

     Also added an entry to the FAQ which answers an unrelated
     question posted to the mailing list, and added the
     changelog to the list of files placed in the MaraDNS doc
     directory when a 'make install' is performed.

     (2001.11.13)

   maradns-0.8.31:

     This is the second beta test candidate for the recursive
     MaraDNS, since I found some bugs after releasing MaraDNS
     0.8.30. See the release notes for MaraDNS 0.8.30 for more
     on the beta starus of MaraDNS.

     Looking through the source code of the revamped hash
     structure, I found a routine which was not revamped. This
     would cause a bug in the case of having two or more zone
     files which happen to hash to the same value--only one of
     the zone files would load. Fixed. I also deleted some
     routines which were based on the old hash structure.

     I have modified MaraDNS so the csv1 hash no longer needs
     to be initialized, since the csv1 hash does nothing but
     waste memory in recursive-only MaraDNS configurations.

     I have added another parameter: timeout_seconds, which is
     how long to wait for a remote DNS server to reply. This is
     mainly useful for slow networks which need more than two
     seconds to get a reply from a DNS server. Note that the
     larger this is, the slower MaraDNS answers queries when a
     DNS server doesn't respond to DNS requests.

     In addition, I have begun work on the tutorial, which
     currently describes how to use MaraDNS in recursive mode,
     and gives an overview of DNS.

     (2001.11.12)

   maradns-0.8.30:

     This is a beta test candidate for the recursive version of
     MaraDNS. Which means that the only changes I will make
     between now and the first beta release are essential bug
     fixes (e.g. bugs not mentioned in the man page), and a
     basic DNS tutorial, since I have received two emails of
     the form "I don't know how to do this DNS stuff, and could
     use some help".

     The bad news is that, because of the excess of greedy
     lawyers in the US, I have added the legal disclaimer to
     all of the man pages for MaraDNS, and, in addition, the
     legal disclaimer appears when MaraDNS is started.

     The good news is that it is possible to have MaraDNS not
     show the legal disclaimer when opening up; MaraDNS tells
     you how to do this when showing the disclaimer.

     The better news is that I have done a major revamping of
     the MaraHash structure. This structure is a structure that
     can both handle records being added, and being removed
     from the hash. MaraDNS, as far as I can tell from my
     offline tests, is now a great deal more stable as a
     result.

     In addition, I found another memory leak in the recursive
     code, which I have plugged.

     I have also performed some more documentation touch-ups.

     (2001.11.10)

   maradns-0.8.29:

     OK, this is a "band-aid" release of MaraDNS. As I was
     debugging the problem with MaraDNS crashing with the new
     custodian, I discovered that the hash code is
     fundamentally broken. Hence, I need to a major revamp to
     the hash code. In short, the hash needs to have each hash
     spot point to a linked list of elements.

     In the meantime, I performed a band-aid fix to the hash
     that, while not fixing the problem, makes the problem
     slightly less bothersome. This is an interim release until
     I can really fix the problem this weekend.

     Updated the FAQ to reflect the slightly changed procedure
     for joinging the MaraDNS mailing list ("subscribe" now has
     to be in the subject line when one wants to join the
     list).

     (2001.11.08)

   maradns-0.8.28:

     I fixed a bug in the fila-handling code where chains of
     records were not being correctly put at the top of the
     list.

     I am still receiving reports that MaraDNS freezes up after
     running for a while. I am unable to reproduce this
     problem. I have carefully checked the recursive code for
     potential deadlocks, finding none.

     I suspect that there is a certain query which causes thie
     problem. Theirfore, I have added the ability for MaraDNS
     to log all queries she receives in human-readable format
     if verbose_level is three or higher.

     While this results in some really huge logs, this will
     hopefully allow me to pin down exactly which query causes
     MaraDNS to lock up, allowing me to see where MaraDNS locks
     up, allowing me to resolve the issue.

     (2001.10.31)

   maradns-0.8.27:

     I have added a lot of code which creates a circular linked
     list. This circular linked list is used by the custodian
     to erase elements from the cache which have not been
     recently accessed.

     The psudo-random number generator has been renamed to
     'rng', and modified to be a hash-only primitive. MaraDNS
     no longer has any code which can be directly used for
     cryptographic purposes. Of course, the compression
     function of the hash/prng is invertable, and can be used
     as a stream cipher, but such is the case for all secure
     hash functions and secure PRNGs.

     Added a list of features I will not add to the 1.x release
     of MaraDNS to the MaraDNS man page.

     The default max_glueless_level is now 10, because some
     real-world hosts need a max_glueless_level this high.

     (2001.10.31)

   maradns-0.8.26:

     I have updated the 0QuickStart file to be current with the
     present state of MaraDNS.

     The Linux makefile now supports "make debug", useful for
     making a build with verbose debugging output.

     Now that I have some decent *roff documentation, I have
     done some improvments to the formatting of the man pages.
     Not only do the man pages look a little more attractive on
     the tty terminal, the man pages also look good when made
     postscript man pages (troff -man -Tps foo.1 > foo.ps).

     In addition, since the -man macros are not documented
     anywhere on the internet, I have somewhat deciphered the
     tmac.an macro set, and written up some documentation
     describing all of the -man macros. (2001.10.15)

   maradns-0.8.25:

     I have done an audit and an overhaul of how MaraDNS calls
     locks in the recursive code. Hopefully, this will resolve
     the issues with MaraDNS freezing after running for a few
     days.

     In addition, the recursive resolver now is better able to
     handle instances where a NS record points to a list of
     IPs.

     More documentation updates. The man page for maradns now
     has a guide on how to set up a firewall to allow maradns
     packets through, and a list of known issues where MaraDNS
     breaks the DNS spec.

     The crypto-emasculated version of MaraDNS no longer binds
     the source port of outgoing UDP queries. This is because
     the underlying OS may generate secure source port numbers
     when the source port is not specified in the application.

     (2001.10.12)

   maradns-0.8.24:

     I have created a tool, called debug.hostname in the tools
     directory, which gives a very verbose trace trying to look
     up a given hostname. This will hopefully help me to debug
     and fix problematical hostnames.

     I have also created a tool, called faq2man which converts
     the HTML faq in to a format suitable for embedding in to a
     man page. This makes the FAQ section of the MaraDNS man
     page more attractive

     I have made the maximum glueless level user-configurable,
     since it looks like some hosts do not resolve with the old
     hard-wired default of 4. I have also made the maximum
     number of queries performed total in a recursive lookup
     user-configurable

     I have added more helpful error messages which tell the
     user what to fix in their mararc file if MaraDNS can not
     initialize the DNS cache or the random number seed. The
     init_cache() and init_crypto() failed error messages
     should not be visible any more.

     Documentation update: There is now a man page description
     of the mararc file. The CREDITS and FAQ files have been
     updated, in addition to almost all man pages. For example,
     I have gotten rid of the two or three pages of ugly troff
     syntax that Perl's pod2man program generates in the Man
     pages which had this.

     make run without ./configure now works again.

     Since MaraDNS used to act in a different manner than
     Python 1.5.2 with respect to multiple declations of the
     same index of the same dictionary variable, I have changed
     MaraDNS so that she exits with a fatal error should this
     occur, showing the user the line with the problem.

     Made the error message which pops up when a csv1 zone file
     pointer is incorrectly formatted more helpful.

     There was a minor security weakness with the PRNG which
     would pop up if the seed was a fixed file, two copies of
     MaraDNS used the same seed file, and the two files were
     started at the same time. This has been fixed. The seed is
     now exclusive-ored with the process ID before generating
     numbers.

     More trimming of unused routines in the AES code. The AES
     code now only supports encryption with a 128-bit key and
     block size in ECB mode--the only way we use AES in
     MaraDNS.

     For people who can not legally have any kind of
     cryptography in their code (French citizens, etc.), there
     is now a script in the tools directory, remove.aes which
     removes all crypto code. Note that, while the main MaraDNS
     suite will still compile after running this, some programs
     in the tools/misc, test and sqa directories will no longer
     compile. make still works, of course. Note that removing
     this code does make MaraDNS more suspectable to a spoofing
     attack.

     (2001.10.08)

   maradns-0.8.23:

     Star records which point to CNAMEs are now completely
     supported.

     Christophe Colle pointed out that the reason MaraDNS was
     leaking memory when making threads on Solaris was because
     MaraDNS was not using pthread_attr_destroy. Hopefully,
     adding this will make MaraDNS not leak on Solaris.

     Improvment to the "make install" process: The default
     configuration looks for local man pages in
     /usr/local/share/man if /usr/local/man doesn't exist. This
     is to get around some Linux distributions which don't have
     /usr/local/man

     Minor security tweak to the routine that generates the
     16-bit secure psudo-random number.

     The AES hasher now correctly generates a 128-version of
     the hash specified in Bram Cohen's proposed AES hash
     standard. Thanks to Bram for providing test vectors for
     the 256-version of the hash.

     maradns --version now also includes the build system and
     date

     (2001.09.27)

   maradns-0.5.30:

     Two bugs have been fixed: A bug where a UDP error message
     normally did not have the correct query ID, and a bug
     where, in certain cases, MaraDNS would return a UDP error
     instead of a SOA "not there" reply.

     Also, the documentation has been updated. (2001.09.25)

   maradns-0.8.22:

     Document reorganization: I am starting to move the formats
     of the data files to separate man pages. This will make
     each man page smaller and more convenient to use.

     Improved CNAME support: MaraDNS now has partial support
     for star records that point to a CNAME.

     Less code in the aes directory: I now have a program which
     generates the AES tables during the build process, since
     the code to generate those tables is a good deal smaller
     than the tables themselves. There is no slowdown, since it
     is a one-time calculation done during the build process.

     maradns --version (and zoneserver --version) now do the
     right thing: Print out the version number and exit

     The installer now removes the zoneserver and the maradns
     server before installing the new ones to get around the
     "text file busy" problem.

     There was a subtle bug with returning "not there" SOA
     replies and case insensitivity. This bug has now been
     fixed. This bugfix also needs to be folded back in to the
     0.5.xx branch.

     It is now possible to change the class of the query with
     the getzone client if possible. Next: Document this new
     feature. (2001.09.24)

   maradns-0.8.21:

     First, the bad news.

     There is a known issue with MaraDNS having memory leaks
     when used as a recursive nameserver on the Solaris
     operating system. This problem does not exist in Linux.
     Since I do not have ready access to a Solaris box to
     develop on, I can not resolve this issue. Until a Solaris
     developer steps up to bat and fixes this for me, I am
     forced to disable recursive DNS serving under Solaris.

     I should have ready access to a Solaris again in December,
     when I return to the United States. I have CDs of Solaris
     eight up there, in addition to friends with Solaris boxes.

     Now, the good news.

     I have updated the example mararc files to be consistant
     with the documentation. In particular, I now have two "out
     of the box" working mararc files. One for authoritative
     name serving, and another for recursive nameserving.

     I have also updated the installer script to return an
     error if the directories to put the MaraDNS files in do
     not exist. In addition, MaraDNS will install all of the
     MaraDNS documentation in the directory specified by the
     variable DOCS in install.locations.

     Finally, I have updated the FAQ, the man pages, the
     mararc.format documentation, and am working on making
     separate man pages which describe csv1 zone files and the
     mararc file. (2001.09.20)

   maradns-0.8.20:

     When doing some tests with the AES engine in MaraDNS, I
     found that I inadvertently created a minor security
     problem w.r.t. ASCII nulls in the AES key. Basically, an
     "out of the box" MaraDNS configuration had a 1 in 16
     chance of the aes key not having a full 128 bits of
     entropy.

     I also corrected a minor fault in the aes128 hasher (it
     did not previously fully follow the spec, since it counted
     bytes, not bits), a minor fault with the top-level
     Makefile (which did not clean up tools/misc with a make
     clean), and did some minor manpage clean-up. (2001.09.18)

   maradns-0.8.19:

     Updated the CREDITS file. If you have contributed to
     MaraDNS in any way, no matter how small, and are not in
     this file, please let me know so I can credit you.

     Removed references to routines in the aes/ directory which
     MaraDNS and aes128 do not use. The aes code is now
     encrypt-only.

     Added a test, based on Brian Gladman's AES reference code,
     which verified that the AES routines are working
     correctly.

     Some cleanup, corrections, and revisions of the man pages.
     I figured out how to turn off hyphenation and justifaction
     for man pages, and have hence disabled these in all of the
     MaraDNS man pages.

     Streamlining of the build process: ./configure; make; make
     install now does "the right thing". In addition, make
     uninstall also automagically does the right thing.

     Important: make install now, by default, installs files in
     /usr/local/sbin, /usr/local/bin, and man pages in
     /usr/local/man. If one has previous installs of MaraDNS in
     other locations, please change the install.sh script to
     the desired location of the MaraDNS files. (2001.09.17)

   maradns-0.8.18:

     Added code which keeps track of allocated memory, allowing
     me to hunt down and eliminate memory leaks. Found four
     memory leaks in the recursive code:
     * in_bailiwick did not properly destroy the tempory string
       "get"
     * When a negative answer was given, query_nameserver did
       not correctly deallocate some temporary strings
     * recurse_call did not correctly deallocate the temporary
       string used for glueless queries
     * The code that set up the root nameservers in the cache
       had two strings which were used to help set up the root
       nameservers. This strings were not deallocated after
       being used. This was a one-time, and not continuous,
       leak.

     (2001.09.15)

   maradns-0.8.17:

     Incorperated a modified form of Franky's patch which adds
     the max_tcp_procs kvar to the program. Added some non-DNS
     releated tools to the "tools" directory. Clean up of the
     documentation. (2001.08.28)

   maradns-0.8.16:

     More regression testing: Added test where it sends an
     answer to a server. If the server replies, this is
     considered an error condition. Cleaned up the recursive
     code (got rid of some XXX to dos): Mainly, MaraDNS sends
     an error if she can not spawn a thread. Documentation
     reorganized. (2001.08.16)

   maradns-0.8.15:

     Made an 'asktest' program which will be used for
     regression testing. (2001.08.15)

   maradns-0.8.14:

     Added support for a counter that counts the children in
     the Zone server. (2001.08.13)

   maradns-0.8.13:

     Askmara doesn't display debug messages which can mess up
     terminals to the end user any more.

     When an element in the cache is overwritten, the new data
     is now added to the cache.

     New feature: MaraDNS can now blacklist spammer-friendly
     DNS servers.

     (2001.08.12)

   maradns-0.8.12:

     Fixed bug in udperror which caused it to spit back the
     wrong query ID.

     Added code to use a counter to count the number of
     threads. If we have more than maxprocs threads going on at
     the same time, we refuse to launch a thread.

     Cached data now will go through round-robin rotates.

     MaraDNS now compiles again when the locale is set to
     Spanish (though I still need more Spanish translations.
     Maybe when I am in México, I can get help down there)
     (2001.08.11)

   maradns-0.5.29:

     Backported some bug fixes with zone file handling back to
     the "stable" authoritative-only branch of MaraDNS.
     (2001.08.10)

   maradns-0.8.11:

     Improved handling of CNAME records in the cache.
     BSD-dependent routines (which are currently unused in
     MaraDNS) are not compiled if we are compiling on a Solaris
     box. (2001.08.08)

   maradns-0.8.10:

     I have redone the makefile in the rijndael directory, some
     some makes (notably, the one NetBSD has) did not like the
     original Makefile. Marked some unreproducable bugs as
     unreproducable. (2001.08.07)

   maradns-0.8.09:

     After much work (handling lame delegations better and
     fixing a bug in substring_issame_case), I have managed to
     get the host name linuxemu.retrofaction.com to resolve.

     Completely unreleated to MaraDNS, I have added a SirCam
     filter to the tools directory. (2001.08.03)

   maradns-0.8.08:

     More bug swatting:
     * The problem that was causing www.fairytale-abuse.com to
       not resolve is fixed. (Better lame delegation handling)
     * The problem that was causing www.cs.cmu.edu and
       www.roaringpenguin.com to not resolve is fixed (Better
       case sensitivity handling)

     (2001.07.28)

   maradns-0.8.07:

     Fixed the zoneserver so it too only answers questions.
     Fixed two bugs in the getzone client: One where it would
     handle MX records incorrectly, another where it would hand
     the root zone incorrectly (this bug was actually in the
     Queries.c file). (2001.07.27)

   maradns-0.8.06:

     We now check to make sure we only answer questions.
     (2001.07.18)

   maradns-0.8.05:

     Added support for multiple root name servers. Also changed
     the example mararc file to have the root servers for eight
     different top level domain registries listed. (2001.07.16)

   maradns-0.5.27:

     Back porting bug fixes to the authoritative-only branch of
     MaraDNS. (2001.07.15)

   maradns-0.8.04:

     MaraDNS now sucessfully compiles on Solaris. Thanks to
     Franky Van Liedekerke for providing the pointers on how to
     do this, and to Danny for access to a Solaris machine to
     compile MaraDNS on. (2001.07.14)

   maradns-0.8.03:

     Solaris support added, but does not fully work, added
     disclaimer, improved code which drops group privileges.
     (2001.07.13)

   maradns-0.8.02:

     Another bug fix: If a zone did not have a record of a
     given type at the "top" of the zone, MaraDNS would attempt
     to perform recursion instead of returning a SOA record in
     the authority section. Fixed. Also needs to be fixed in
     the 0.5.xx branch. Thanks to D Richard Felker III for
     finding the bug. (2001.07.10)

   maradns-0.8.01:

     Touch up bug fix: MaraDNS failed to close open file
     descripters when reading zone files. Fixed. Also needs to
     be fixed in the 0.5.xx series. Thanks to Boris Manojlovic
     for finding the bug. (2001.07.09)

   maradns-0.5.26:

     Fixed a couple of long-standing bugs found while debugging
     the recursive version of MaraDNS:
     * Fixed a subtle bug in the DNS compression code that would
       only show up in certain rare circumstances.
     * Fixed a bug in the handling of ANY DNS queries.

     (2001.07.08)

   maradns-0.8.00:

     This is the first alpha release of the recursive
     nameserver. I fixed a bug in the compression code, and
     fixed another bug which was causing problems with glueless
     name server entries. (2001.07.08)

   maradns-0.7.22:

     www.monty.de now successfully resolves; fixed bug where
     the custodian could potentially erase the root name server
     entry, making MaraDNS non-functional as a root nameserver
     until restarted. (2001.07.07)

   maradns-0.7.21:

     Type ANY queries now work for recursive queries. Finally.
     (2001.07.06)

   maradns-0.7.20:

     Another late night double feature MaraDNS show. There was
     a really nasty bug which Jaakko pointed out to me. I found
     the culprit, and fixed the bug. (2001.07.04)

   maradns-0.7.19:

     Begun work on some of the infastructure changes needed to
     make MaraDNS sucessfully resolve recursive ANY queries.
     Added maradns_gid support. Other pieces of code cleanup,
     primarily better handling of RR_ANY when acting as an
     authoritative nameserver (should I fold these changes in
     to a 0.5.26 release eventually?). (2001.07.04)

   maradns-0.7.18:

     Re-arranging of the engine that returns an answer from the
     cache. We check the cache expire of a "host not here"
     reply. Updated the documentation so that it is the 0.5.25
     documentation with the recursive stuff added as needed.
     (2001.07.01)

   maradns-0.7.17:

     We now choose a random DNS server to query when we are
     looking for an answer. (2001.07.01)

   maradns-0.7.16:

     Updated documentation to include information on how to set
     up a recursive nameserver. Fixed bug where multiple levels
     of CNAME indirection were not being properly followed. It
     is now possible to go to www.imdb.com or groups.yahoo.com
     (both cases of multiple levels of CNAME indirection).
     (2001.06.30)

   maradns-0.7.15:

     I have added support for negative caching: If a given host
     name does not exist, the program sends a "not here" to the
     stub resolver. I also fixed a bug which was causing
     out-of-bailiwock queries to not work. (Having to do with
     the case-sensitivity issue). Next: Getting www.monty.de to
     work, caching ANY replies. (2001.06.28)

   maradns-0.7.14:

     MaraDNS now works as a recursive nameserver again. The
     root nameserver is now user-configurable. CNAME returns
     queries in a form that a stub resolver can now understand.
     (2001.06.25)

   maradns-0.7.13:

     After much tinkering with the code, I have managed to make
     it so that a CNAME record in the cache returns the
     corresponding A record (note: only one A record!) along
     with the CNAME record. This should allow hosts like
     www.yahoo.com to work when this is used as a stub
     resolver. (2001.06.24)

   maradns-0.7.12:

     More work done on plugging memory leaks. Working on code
     that will determine the ip for a given CNAME record, since
     stub resolvers are not smart enough to do a second A query
     themselves when they see a CNAME record. Also some minor
     cleanups that Franky Van Liedekerke suggested.
     (2001.06.22)

   maradns-0.7.11:

     Finished work on the custodian. Now, I need to make sure
     the custodian works. Also fixed CNAME support so it now
     works, plugged a couple more memory leaks, and revised the
     offline testbed to have a CNAME record. (2001.06.21)

   maradns-0.7.10:

     Bigfixes: I have plugged some memory leaks, and added code
     which will (hopefully) allow recursive queries to cname
     records to work. I have also done some more work on the
     "custodian" code. (2001.06.21)

   maradns-0.7.09:

     Bugfix release: MaraDNS now closes the sockets that she
     opens when performing recursive queries. This stops the
     open sockets from piling up. Also, I have begun work on
     the "custodian" code: Code the reduces the number of
     elements in the cache when the user-defined cache runs low
     on space. (2001.06.20)

   maradns-0.7.08:

     I have made the RNG truly random, and I have added code to
     the resolution algorithm which allows it to perform
     recursive queries when the only authoritative records are
     NS delegation records. Also, updates to the todo list.
     Changed cc to gcc in all the makefiles to make MaraDNS
     more Solaris-friendly. (2001.06.20)

   maradns-0.7.07:

     I have added ACLs which limit who is allowed to make
     recursive queries. I have also begun work on making the
     random number seed truly random. (2001.06.19)

   maradns-0.7.06:

     I have updated the non-recursive code to use code from
     MaraDNS 0.5.25, which adds a number of features from there
     (round robin rotation, etc.) I have alos made a list of
     things which need to be done before I can make this a beta
     candidate for a 1.0 release. In addition, the code now
     makes sure that the query ID we receive is the same one we
     sent out. I have also started work on a CREDITS file,
     updated the FAQ, and added a couple of interesting (if not
     MaraDNS-specific) Perl scripts to the archive.
     (2001.06.17)

   maradns-0.7.05:

     The DNS server now has a psudo-random number generator
     which uses the Rijndael algorithm. This PRNG randomizes
     both the query ID and (I believe) the source port of any
     and all DNS queries. This PNRG now needs to become secure
     (by setting up either a random or a user-defined Rijndael
     key) (2001.06.16)

   maradns-0.7.04:

     There were some bugs in the RR expire code. I have found
     those bugs, fixed them, and now cache expirery should
     work. (2001.06.12)

   maradns-0.7.03:

     This release has implemented the ability to expire records
     from the cache. All Name server records have a fixed
     expire of 1 day (this can be changed by changing one
     #define in recursive.c), but all other records have an
     expire time based on the TTL of the record. I have not yet
     tested DNS RR expire. (2001.06.11)

   maradns-0.7.02:

     Milestone: This is the first release of MaraDNS that works
     as a recursive nameserver with the real root nameservers.
     Fix: Changing only the case of the first nameserver, add
     negative caching, then start adding security (good RNG for
     the query ID and source port, recursive ACL), then start
     making the root servers customizable (including being able
     to have different TLDs have different root servers).
     (2001.06.11)

   maradns-0.7.01:

     Beginning work on making MaraDNS both case-insensitive and
     able to preserve case. (2001.06.06)

   maradns-0.7.00:

     Albert Prats kindly provided Spanish translations for
     various text files. To get MaraDNS to compile in Spanish
     instead of English, type in ./locale.es before compiling
     MaraDNS.

     MaraDNS now can handle gluelessness. I am bumping up the
     minor version number to reflect that MaraDNS now has
     recursive nameserving capabilities, albeit without some
     security features. Next: Work on cache flushing and
     security. (2001.06.03)

   maradns-0.6.21:

     Now, if one of the IP nameservers is bad, we will try the
     next nameserver in the chain. Next: Add the code to handle
     out-of-bailiwick nameservers (2001.06.01)

   maradns-0.6.20:

     Two big improvments: 1) The recursive resolver can now
     handle multiple A records (MaraDNS deliberately ignores NS
     and AR records. Note that it is a good idea to give out
     the corresponding A record for a CNAME record [To do]) 2)
     There is now code which makes a local copy of the chain of
     NS records in an authoritative-only section, which will
     allow me to make thread-safe code which will query other
     nameservers, should a given nameserver not function (e.g.
     Someone changed a computer's IP. In the three weeks it can
     take Network Solutions to update the records on the root
     nameservers, we still want to be able to reach the domain
     in question by using the other listed nameserver for the
     domain)

   maradns-0.6.19:

     Not only did I get to spend some time with my family this
     memorial day weekend, I also was able to get Linux up and
     going on my new laptop. Took two installs, but everything
     except SSL in Konqueror now works. I also, now that the
     new laptop is (mostly) up and going, have gotten a chance
     to work on MaraDNS. This new laptop, since it has a
     working battery, should speed up MaraDNS development--I
     can now work on MaraDNS on the train. The latest version
     is able to go to a remote server and give us an incomplete
     answer (only one RR) based on what the remote server tells
     us. (2001.05.29)

   maradns-0.6.18:

     Some minor bugfixes and tweaks: The nameserver will now
     query name servers until it is able to find an answer,
     then it will go in a loop. (2001.05.24)

   maradns-0.6.17:

     A fairly significant milestone: This version of MaraDNS is
     able to read data from an authoritative nameserver, and,
     based on that data, determine the IP of a nameserver
     closer to the answer we are looking for. (2001.05.21)

   maradns-0.5.24:

     Two minor bug fixes: The erre-con-erre-cigarro.maradns.org
     query will work, even if authoritative nameservers for the
     root are set up; MaraDNS now will run on systems which do
     not support the setrlimit system call, such as the GNU
     Hurd. (2001.05.21)

   maradns-0.5.23:

     Three bug fixes: MaraDNS now works with RRs for the root
     namserver (MaraDNS, in fact, can now be a nameserver for
     the root), the askmara tool now has a timeout (and can ask
     questions about the root nameserver), and the output that
     MaraDNS generates is unbuffered. (2001.05.19)

   maradns-0.6.16:

     I have added a lot more debugging stuff as I hunt down why
     it is RRs are not being added to the dns RR cache. I think
     I am pretty close to pinning it down, and hope tomorrow's
     release can add RRs to the big cache. (2001.05.18)

   maradns-0.6.15:

     I added a simple interactive debugger which lets me see
     the state of the DNS cache hash table. Looks like the data
     from the server is not being added to the cache. Next:
     FInd out why not. (2001.05.17)

   maradns-0.6.14:

     An unexpected event forcing me to go home late yesterday
     caused there not to be a release of MaraDNS yesterday.

     Fixed bug where it was not correctly appending the class
     to the server that it was querying. Temporarily disabled
     the actual threading while development work on the
     recurseor continues. Next: Make sure that the cache is
     properly seeded from data from authoritative nameservers.
     (2001.05.17)

   maradns-0.6.13:

     Fixed bug where it was choosing the wrong IP to query.
     Automated the process of setting up a testbed (which is
     completely self-contained), so I can debug this on a
     variety of machines. Next: Fix the timeout bug.
     (2001.05.15)

   maradns-0.6.12:

     MaraDNS compiles again. Now, I need to go through all the
     code and iron out all of the bugs. Testbed of MaraDNS
     configuration files added. (2001.05.14)

   maradns-0.6.11:

     More work on the recursive stuff done. (2001.05.13)

   maradns-0.6.10:

     More work on the recursive stuff done. (2001.05.12)

   maradns-0.5.22:

     Bugfix release: non-0 opcodes now correctly return a "NOT
     IMPLEMENTED" error message. Also, some minor cleanup in
     the documentation: star records (*.example.com, etc.) are
     now documented. (2001.05.10)

   maradns-0.6.09:

     add_closer_jsddip, add_closer_js, and add_closer_jsip now
     have a third argument: Whether to overwrite or append to
     already existing data in the cache. Since the autoconf
     stuff doesn't work with the development branch, I got rid
     of it for now. Once this code gets stable, one of the
     Debian packagers can feel free to add the autoconf stuff
     again. (2001.05.10)

   maradns-0.6.08:

     Added in_bailiwick and cmp_dnames functions to recursive.c
     (2001.05.09)

   maradns-0.5.21:

     Feature enhancment: Added round-robin rotation of records
     and limits to the number of records that can be displayed
     for a given answer to MaraDNS. This will be the last
     feature enhancment for the 0.5.xx tree. All changes in the
     0.5.xx tree will now be bug fixes. Now, back to work on
     the 0.6.xx series, starting off with integrating the
     0.5.xx changes. (2001.05.07)

   maradns-0.5.20:

     Feature enhancment: We now make sure that the same AR
     record does not show up twice in the AR section. Thanks to
     Phil Homewood for pointing out this problem. (2001.05.06)

   maradns-0.5.19:

     Bugfix release: We now follow chains of records in the AR
     section. The authoritative bit for an "RR_ALL" request is
     now determined by the authoritative bit in the first RR
     found. Thanks to Phil Homewood for finding these bugs.
     (2001.05.06)

   maradns-0.6.07:

     The askmara tool now uses select() to time out after three
     seconds. Added a lot of code to the recursive lookup. I
     now send a query to the remote server, and receive the
     reponse. Next: Code to process the response and add the
     data to the local cache. (2001.05.06)

   maradns-0.6.06:

     The recursive code now sucessfully seeds a root nameserver
     in to the cache. Next: Code to query and get the response
     form that nameserver. (2001.05.05)

   maradns-0.6.05:

     Heavy debugging of the recursive stuff going on. It is not
     fixed, but I wanted to post something, however miniscule,
     before going to bed. (2001.05.04)

   maradns-0.5.18:

     Addded new feature: default_rrany_set, which is used to
     change the RRs returned when a RR_ANY query is sent to the
     MaraDNS server. Thanks to Phil Homewood who pointed out
     that this is sometimes needed. (2001.05.03)

   maradns-0.6.04:

     recursive text documented updated to reflect changes I
     made on the train. Some other cleanup. (2001.05.02)

   maradns-0.6.03:

     Wrote up document detailing the recursive algorithm that
     MaraDNS' recursive resolver will use. Integrated the
     0.5.17 bugfixes in to the development tree. (2001.05.01)

   maradns-0.5.17:

     Fixed bug in MaraDNS' handling of zone transfers where the
     response is a single big RR instead of multiple small RRs.
     Some other small bugfixes. (2001.04.30)

   maradns-0.6.02:

     I have the general structure of how I want to do the
     recursive name serving in place. The devil, however, is in
     the details. (2001.04.28)

   maradns-0.6.01:

     Fixes in MaraDNS-0.5.16 incorporated in to development
     branch. Slowly making progress on the recursive code.
     (2001.04.26)

   maradns-0.5.16:

     Fixed bug in the zoneserver's handling of replies longer
     than 255 octets in length. Fixed problem in manpage and
     updated man page. Special thanks to Phil Homewood for
     finding problems the zone server was having. (2001.04.26)

   maradns-0.6.00:

     Work on making MaraDNS recursive begins. (2001.04.26)

   maradns-0.5.15:

     Fatal error messages caused by failed system calls now
     show the user the error message that the system gave, in
     addition to MaraDNS' error message. (2001.04.26)

   maradns-0.5.14:

     Added "no_fingerprint" feature which minimizes the
     MaraDNS-specific features, making it more difficult to
     determine which DNS server one is running. (2001.04.23)

   maradns-0.5.13:

     Manpage for maradns added. (2001.04.22)

   maradns-0.5.12:

     Added better support for CNAME records: If the CNAME
     record points to an A record, and we have the A record "on
     file", MaraDNS will add the CNAME record to the ar section
     of the reply. Also added support for getting the version
     number for maradns via a
     'erre-con-erre-cigarro.maradns.org.' TXT query. Set things
     up so we can both a autoconf-based and a
     non-autoconf-based build process, and we can switch
     between the two. Next: Branch off to development again,
     because I need to get the zone server multithreaded.
     (2001.04.22)

   maradns-0.5.11:

     Tollef Fog Heen generously ran autoconf for MaraDNS. The
     build process now consists of './configure;make'".
     (2001.04.21)

   maradns-0.5.10:

     Code cleanup: I added -Wall as an option in the libs, dns,
     and server directories. Cleanup of all the warnings that
     -Wall generated. Added /etc/mararc and
     /var/maradns/db.example.com to RPM file. (2001.04.20)

   maradns-0.5.09:

     The server crashes were causes by pointers that were not
     correctly initialized to zero. The pointers causing the
     crash have been initialized, and hopefully this one will
     be crashproof. Next: Look for other incorrectly
     initialized variables. (2001.04.20)

   maradns-0.5.08:

     Begin a "stable" brach for the only-authoritative
     non-threaded nameserver. Changed compiler option from -g
     to -O2. Made RPM of MaraDNS-0.5.08. (2001.04.19)

   maradns-0.5.07:

     Plugged some memory leaks in the zoneserver which, while
     not currently a problem, could have been a problem if I
     had started coding threads before plugging the memory
     leaks. Some of the leaks were is the js_string library, so
     that code base is a lot cleaner now. Made the functions in
     ParseCsv1.c thread-safe. My friend Fatma generously
     supplied a German translation of the error strings in
     MaraDNS_en.h--we now have a MaraDNS_de.h which, while not
     perfect, will be appreciated by the Germans. (2001.04.18)

   maradns-0.5.06:

     The zone server for MaraDNS can now be run from inetd. Due
     to the security implications of this (MaraDNS' IP-based
     ACLs stop working when run from inetd), this will be an
     undocumented feature. (2001.04.18)

   maradns-0.5.05:

     Phil Homewood generously supplied a patch that makes this
     compile on FreeBSD. In addition, he fixed a bug in the
     Makefile in dns/Makefile which made it so bobbit.c
     compiles instead of using the Linux-specific object file
     (Which I didn't catch, since make clean didn't remove it
     and make didn't recreate it). I also fixed a bug in
     getzone.c which was introduced when I put the string
     literals in a language-specific file. (2001.04.17)

   maradns-0.5.04:

     Added more support for dotted decimal IPs in NS, CNAME,
     and MX records. Added handles for code which will warn the
     user of the presence of these dotted-decimal IP records.
     Fixed bug where js_copy was not returning an appropriate
     value on success (2001.04.17)

   maradns-0.5.03:

     If a "give me all records for a given hostname" query
     appears, MaraDNS will now look for a CNAME with the same
     hostname, returning only that if found (and she will only
     look for a CNAME if an A and MX were not found), and if A,
     MX, and CNAME records are not found, MaraDNS will see if
     the person entered a dotted decimal ip and respond
     appropriately. (2001.04.16)

   maradns-0.5.02:

     Most of the text messages that MaraDNS' various utilities
     generate have been moved to separate files, which will
     make localization easier. (2001.04.16)

   maradns-0.5.01: Bugfix: Since mail exchangers routinely ask
   for "all records" queries (to get both A and MX records), I
   have hacked MaraDNS to deliver A and MX records if a request
   for all records is received. I still need to code the case of
   a request for "all records" pointing to a CNAME, though.
   Also, I have added a benchmark tool which times a DNS server
   by sending 50,000 queries to the server in question as
   quickly as possible. (2001.04.13)

   maradns-0.5.00: The UDP server no longer fork()s off
   processes to process queries. I performed a mild stress test,
   where MaraDNS was processing 81 queries a second for over an
   hour--MaraDNS performed beautifully--memory usage did not
   increase, and queries were fast during this test. I am making
   this release the stable branch. Next: Get string literals out
   of the code. (2001.04.12)

   maradns-0.4.04: More bug fixes: Plugged potential memory
   leaks in js_buf_getline. Fixed bug where the last line of a
   csv1 file was not read. Fixed makefile so that it cleans
   files in new location of the zonefile stuff--it's now in a
   directory called "tuzona". Next: Go from a multi-process
   model to a single process model. (2001.04.12)

   maradns-0.4.03: Bugfix: The zone server is now hacked up to
   give a plausable-looking answer to a SOA request on the TCP
   port. As a result, BIND 4 and BIND 8 will now transfer zones
   from the maradns zoneserver. (2001.04.12)

   maradns-0.4.02: Bigfix: Hacked zoneserver so that it can work
   as a zone server in cases where the zone transfer client asks
   for the SOA record before downloading the zone. Also: Added
   the ability to verbosely log invalid queries sent to the DNS
   server, and to have a log level of 0 make MaraDNS give out no
   logs whatsoever. Next: Fix bug where the last line of a csv1
   file is not parsed. (2001.04.12)

   maradns-0.4.01: Bugfix: Fixed bug where SOA records were not
   properly loaded when we have multiple zones. (2001.04.11)

   maradns-0.4.00: Stable branch: This is the stable branch of
   MaraDNS, which will only be updated with security fixes. Made
   zoneserver check the query type, and drop connection on
   anything besides AXFR and IXFR (Hack: The zone server treats
   an IXFR exactly like an AXFR). Also cleaned up the error
   handling in the zone and udp server code in preparation to
   make maradns multithreaded. (2001.04.11)

   maradns-0.3.06: Security fix: The zone transfer client now
   checks for and disables any out-of-baliwick records it finds
   when performing a zone transfer. Feature enhancment: Maradns
   now has a working zone transfer server. (2001.04.10)

   maradns-0.3.05: An entire parsing engine which processes
   ip-based ACLs has been created, complete with recursive
   aliases. Zoneserver now only needs the code that reads the
   client's request and send them the zone they ask for (as long
   as they have access). (2001.04.08)

   maradns-0.3.04: TXT, A, and MX records are now "pretty
   printed" when downloaded from a foreign zone. All seven RR
   types supported by MaraDNS are now pretty printed. Fixed bug
   with the handling of "umbrella" NS records. Fixed bug with
   the handling of high serial numbers and extra-long TTL
   values. Next: the AXFR server. (2001.04.04)

   maradns-0.3.03: The getzone program in tcp now generates
   working, albeit ugly (too many RR types are still marked
   'U'), MaraDNS zone files based on the data from a zone
   transfer. Also found and fixed other bugs the popped up when
   stressing the various queries routines with a full Zone
   transfer. Unreleated to MaraDNS per se, MaraDNS now has a
   `real' web page. (Thanks, Leo!) (2001.04.04)

   maradns-0.3.02: Added support for truncating headers. Began
   work on getzone zone transfer client. (2001.04.03)

   maradns-0.3.01: Fixed bug where the MX preference changed on
   DNS compressing and DNS decompressing. (2001.04.01)

   maradns-0.3.00: The DNS compression routines now work. Also
   set up the server to return "Not implemented" to the
   unimplemented requests for zone transfers and the
   unimplemented requests for all RRs attached to a hostname.
   (2001.04.01)

   maradns-0.2.10: My theory is that they made DNS comprssion so
   difficult to implement out of fear that anyone would be crazy
   enough to write their own DNS server. Continued work on the
   compression routines. (2001.03.31)

   maradns-0.2.09: Moved check for star records attached to
   CNAME or to NS RRs in the CSV1 parser, where it belongs.
   Added support for "notfound" reply. Next: RFC1035 compression
   (ugh). (2001.03.29)

   maradns-0.2.08: Added support for ddip addresses (An IP query
   for '127.1.1.1' gives the IP '127.1.1.1'). Added almost full
   support for star records. Only these somewhat silly star
   record cases are not supported: Star records pointing to
   CNAMEs and to NSs records. Added code that warns the user if
   they try to add an unsupported star record type. Next: The
   code to give out a "notfound" reply. (2001.03.28)

   maradns-0.2.07: Fixed bug in MaraDNS' handling of case
   folding. Added some support for star records. (2001.03.27)

   maradns-0.2.06: A and CNAME queries are now case-insensitive.
   Changed the bs_process routine to have domain-labels
   converted to their lower-case format before octal processing
   is done (so we can still have 'A' in a domain label with
   '\101') Returns NS delegation if we asked for a host in a
   sub-delegated domain. (2001.03.27)

   maradns-0.2.05: Cleaned up the makefile so that we don't have
   compiled binaries in any of the directories after a "make
   clean" is performed. Added support for CNAME and limited NS
   record support. (2001.03.26)

   maradns-0.2.04: New security feature: Maxprocs, which is a
   mandatory way of limiting the resources MaraDNS uses. Added
   fix.perms tool. (2001.03.26)

   maradns-0.2.03: I have made the directory structure a little
   cleaner. The only problem I have now is that multiple
   Makefiles have to be changed if I add a new object file. I
   also have improved the way MaraDNS cleans up after her
   children. (2001.03.26)

   maradns-0.2.02: Now, MaraDNS correctly returns NS records and
   AN records for every query where it has NS and AN records in
   its local database. While I wait for the clows at NSI to
   figure out why we can't make maradns.com and maradns.org use
   ns.maradns.com and ns.maradns.org as name servers for both
   domains, I can test things with www.z.maradns.org
   (2001.03.25)

   maradns-0.2.01: Bugfix: SOA lines can now have percent escape
   sequences in them. (2001.03.25)

   maradns-0.2.00: Incremented minor number in light of the fact
   MaraDNS now actually resolves, albeit in a very limited
   fashion. Added some QuickStart notes, and added the ability
   for uint16s and uint32s to be added directly to the end of a
   JS_STRING object. (2001.03.25)

   maradns-0.1.40: MaraDNS now resolves hosts. It doesn't handle
   a lot of cases where the resolution is not an exact match (NS
   records for stuff below us, star records, etc.) nor does it
   give us NS or AN records, nor the IP for a Cname record (if
   applicable), but at least MaraDNS is finally resolving. To
   do: js_string function for adding uint16s and uin32s in a
   single fell swoop, and real name resolution. (2001.03.25)

   maradns-0.1.39: At this point, MaraDNS binds to a port and
   listens to incoming data. Next: Actually process the data
   that she gets (2001.03.24)

   maradns-0.1.38: Added the code that adds pointers to the
   corresponding A records for MX, NS, and CNAME records.
   (2001.03.23)

   maradns-0.1.37: Placed the code that converts star records in
   a more sensible location. Added a new element in the rr
   answer which is a pointer to the query string (we need this
   so we can tell the resolver both the question and the answer
   with the NS records, and which IP addresses go with which
   answers in the AR records) (2001.03.21)

   maradns-0.1.36: Now we convert star records (record which
   start off with a * label) to an EDNS-style format MaraDNS
   uses for its internal hash of RRs (2001.03.19)

   maradns-0.1.35: Verified that records are placed in the bug
   hash correctly. Next: We can now start making this a working
   DNS server. Bind to the port, answering UDP queries using a
   simple forking model. (2001.03.18)

   maradns-0.1.34: Added some more security features: It now
   chroot's and changes the uid if it is run as root. Also made
   a function that adds a RR to the end of a chain of RRs before
   the first NS RR. (2001.03.17)

   maradns-0.1.33: Plugged up some memory leaks in MaraHash.c.
   Added a lot of code which starts populating the big hash with
   data. (2001.03.17)

   maradns-0.1.32: More work on the the populate+bighash
   routine. Now, when a syntax error is encountered, MaraDNS
   makes a best-faith effort to continue processing zone files.
   (2001.03.16)

   maradns-0.1.31: Additional work on that routine. Now, it
   correctly make sure that we add the NS records for the zone
   before the NS records, and also fixed some other bugs in this
   routine. Next: Make add_rr_to_bighash really check the
   authority of a record and and data to the big hash
   (2001.03.15)

   maradns-0.1.30: Worked on the routine to fill up the "big
   hash" with the appropriate data. Now, I need to replace the
   "dummy" add_rr_to_bighash with a routine that adds the
   appropriate rr to the big hash (if appropriate). (2001.03.14)

   maradns-0.1.29: Installed a new verison of Linux on my Laptop
   (Esware 2.0r2, a Spanish RedHat clone with the 2.4 kernel).
   Begun work on MaraDNS.c. Next: continue work on MaraDNS.c
   (2001.03.13)

   maradns-0.1.28: Made all of the string literals in
   ParseMaraRc.c labels which point to entries in
   ParseMaraRc_en.h. Wrote and documented Perl script which
   automates this kind of work. I did the same with ParseCsv1.c
   (ParseCsv1_en.h). (2001.03.11)

   maradns-0.1.27: Pasted in read/write/setup kvar code from the
   code that parsed the kiwirc file in the kiwi2 anti-spam
   package. Modified mararc code so that it can parse both
   simple strings and dictionaries (Assosciative arrays) Next:
   The code that populates the DNS lookup hash based on the data
   read from the mararc file. (2001.03.11)

   maradns-0.1.26: Made the code that parses mararc lines a
   little more senisible. It's still hackish, but is somewhat
   pedantic about what kind of syntax it accepts, returning
   errors when wrong syntax is given to it. (2001.03.10)

   maradns-0.1.25: Added support for % in csv1 file. Revised
   csv1.format document. Next: figure out a way to store "star
   records" in the hash table in such a way as to not step on
   the EDNS standards. And implement that method. (2001.03.09)

   maradns-0.1.24: Added support for MX and "Unknown"
   (user-specified query type) data types. Added support for
   '\xxx'-style escape sequences, making it possible to have
   arbitrary data in the csv1 zone file. (2001.03.08)

   maradns-0.1.23: Changed js_atoi to return unsigned integers.
   Added support for TXT and SOA records. Tested to make sure
   error correction looks good. Next: PTR shorthand, more
   efficient Makefile. (2001.03.07)

   maradns-0.1.22: Split off some of the routines in other files
   to new .c files: ParseCsv1.c and Utf8.c. Created js_addbyte
   routine. Added csv1test and example_csv1 files to test the
   csv1 parsing routines. Created js_changebyte routine.
   ParseCsv1 routine now parses all data types except for the
   SOA datatype. Next: SOA datatype, shortcut for PTR datatype.
   (2001.03.07)

   maradns-0.1.21: Wrote utf8test to test the ability to convert
   ISO 8859-1 strings to UTF-8 strings. Found minor bug in code,
   fixed, and now ISO 8859-1 strings are correctly copied. I had
   to set up X and recompile xterm to support all this. Cleaned
   up the comments in the js_notmatch_offset code (they were
   never cleaned up from the Kiwi days). Clean up of some code
   in Queries.c. Wrote about half of the line parsing code for
   parsing csv1 lines. csv1 format doc clean up. (2001.03.07)

   maradns-0.1.20: I have decided that MaraDNS will use UTF-8 to
   support international characters in domain names. I have
   added the draft RFC for UTF8 domain names and a description
   of UTF8 in the docs. In terms of code, we now have code that
   converts ISO 8859-1 to UTF-8. In addition, I have written up
   a couple of documents describing the csv1 non-standard Zone
   file format, and how MaraDNS will resolve a domain name.
   (2001.03.06)

   maradns-0.1.19: Added routines to handle getting all of the
   keys of a hash in series (in the semi-random order they are
   in the hash table). Corrected errors in parseline code, it
   now works with foo["bar"] = "baz" lines and no longer
   considers foo["bar"] = baz legal. foo["bar"] = 1 is still
   legal. (2001.03.04)

   maradns-0.1.18: More ParseMaraRC hacking (this this is a real
   hack. A really bad hack. At least the elegant js_string lib
   stops it from being a security problem). It now has routines
   that can fill up an assosciative array based on
   user-specified keys and values. Next: Routine that reads the
   rc file, and, based on the data there, begins reading zone
   files. The zone files will then be read in turn, and then
   populate a hash. (2001.03.03)

   maradns-0.1.17: More ParseMaraRC.c hacking. Now, it can parse
   'foo = {}', 'foo["bar"] = "baz"', and 'foo = "bar"'. Next:
   Write the routine to read an entire maradnsrc (maybe we
   should just call this mararc) and fill up the hash table with
   the names of all of the zones. (2001.03.03)

   maradns-0.1.16: Modified js_anq_chars handle just numerics.
   Made it correctly handle just alphabetics. Renamed 'ctest' to
   'askmara'. Rewrote askmara.c to have all labels in another
   file (askmara_labels_en.h), to make translation easier.
   (2001.03.02)

   maradns-0.1.15: Continuing the retooling of code from the
   KiwiSpam package to use assosciative arrays in ParseMaraRC.c.
   Yes, this whole parser is a hack instead of a proper parser.
   Right now, the single line parser groks foo["bar"] = baz.
   Next: get it to grok foo = {} (2001.03.01)

   maradns-0.1.14: Beginning the retooling of code from the
   KiwiSpam package to use assosciative arrays in ParseMaraRC.c.
   This will be a fairly extensive code rewrite, considering the
   code I am modding is somewhat hacky itself. (2001.03.01)

   maradns-0.1.13: Fixed bug where ctest resolver program did
   not print out SOA replies (2001.02.28)

   maradns-0.1.12: Added support for TXT in ctest resolver code.
   Made ctest code more hardy--it validates all input and
   returns an error if there is a problem at any point.
   (2001.02.27)

   maradns-0.1.11: Support for MX and SOA, and a number of other
   formats that may have compressed data in them now added to
   the decompression routine. ctest now can parse any RR that
   MaraDNS fully supports except TXT (A, NS, SOA, MX, CNAME,
   HINFO), and is now a rather verbose dig replacment. Got rid
   of the cruft variables in the decompression routine. Next:
   Have a routine to decode TXT data. (2001.02.27)

   maradns-0.1.10: You know how to handle buggy code? Rewirte
   the code so that it is simpler and less buggy. A lot of the
   overhead I had was not needed to keep things secure. The docs
   on how MaraDNS handles decompression have been revised also.
   RFC1035 decompression now works, still need to add MX and
   SOA, and possibly support for other data types that get
   compressed (SRV, the obscure RFC1035 datatypes, etc.) Also,
   get rid of some of the cruft variables in the decompression
   code. (2001.02.26)

   maradns-0.1.09: Had a good weekend. Got to see a friend of
   mine and his wife get baptised. Continued work on
   decompress_data. It is still buggy, but I am working out the
   bugs. (2001.02.26)

   maradns-0.1.08: Added read_rr_h. Also began work on
   decompress_data (Ugh. rfc1035 compression is horrible.)
   (2001.02.22)

   maradns-0.1.07: Fixed potential overflow in rtest (probably
   never exploitable) Discovered that DNS servers do not support
   QDCOUNT > 1 in DNS queries. Made notes in "doc" about this.
   (2001.02.21)

   maradns-0.1.06: ctest now sends correctly formed DNS queries
   to a DNS server (2001.02.21)

   maradns-0.1.05: Added hname_2rfc1035, which does the reverse
   of hname_translate. Beginning work on ctest, which is a test
   DNS client, to see what kind of replies we get from DNS
   servers. (2001.02.21)

   maradns-0.1.04: Debugged routines in Query.c that convert a
   RFC1035 question in to a query. Added routine that converts a
   RFC1035 domain name (with class) in to a dotted-decimal
   hostname. (2001.02.20)

   maradns-0.1.03: Began work on debugging routines in Query.
   Time to go to work (2001.02.20)

   maradns-0.1.02: Wrote first (test-only) server that listens
   on port 53. Using this server to determine what kind of data
   resolvers ask for. (2001.02.20)

   maradns-0.1.01: Added some more RFC1035 data to MaraDns.h
   (2001.02.20)

   maradns-0.1.00: Begin work on handlers to handle various data
   types that RFC1035 has. (2001.02.20)

   maradns-0.0.08: Added js_anq_chars, js_alpha_chars, and
   js_an_chars to JsStrCP object. (2001.02.19)

   maradns-0.0.07: Good morning! Added mtuple_new, mtuple_put,
   and mtuple_get functions. Fixed bug where mhash_inc would
   allow a return value of 0. Fixed Makefile so make clean
   cleans up mtest binary. Added bounds testing to mhash_resize
   hashtable size. Time to eat breakfast. (2001.02.19)

   maradns-0.0.06: Added mara_tuple support and verified that
   hash collisions are properly handled. Time to go to evening
   church recital. (2001.02.18)

   maradns-0.0.05: Corrected mhash_resize to blank out the hash
   we resize to. Create mtest.c program to test the creation of
   hash elements. Time to get ready for church. (2001.02.18)

   maradns-0.0.04: We now properly handle the case of trying to
   add an element already there (return an error), and have more
   error checking to make sure we don't crash because of corrupt
   hash data. Added an interactive test which lets the user
   interactively add, delete, and view hash elements. Time to go
   to bed (2001.02.18)

   maradns-0.0.03: Some more work has been done. mhash_undef_js
   and mhash_resize functions written and compile. (2001.02.18)

   maradns-0.0.02: MaraHash functions--assosciative array
   methods utilizing a hash--have been set up. This has the
   functions mhash_create, mhash_js, mhash_inc, mhash_put,
   mhash_get, mhash_undef, mhash_put_js, and mhash_get_js.
   Debugging done--these functions can perform basic get/put
   operatins with elements in an assosciative array.
   (2001.02.18)

   maradns-0.0.01: First version of MaraDNS package. Added
   iso-8859-1 support to JsStr routines. Added js_qappend and
   js_qprepend functions there. In addition to js_qfgrep. All
   tested functions work and are without error. (2001.02.17)
